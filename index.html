    <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">Introduction</h2>
    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p class="c6"><span>From Vannevar Bush&#39;s memex to Al Gore&rsquo;s </span><span class="c8">Our Choice</span><span>&nbsp;app, the many possibilities of electronic technologies surpassing the codex have been theorized and prototyped, yet the most common form of a digital book is still the ebook. Historically, the field of digital humanities traces its roots to Roberto Busa&rsquo;s </span><span class="c8">Index Thomisticus</span><span>, a digitization project to make the texts of St. Thomas Aquinas available for text search and analysis. Since then, many projects like </span><span class="c8">Project Gutenberg</span><span>, </span><span class="c8">Internet Archive Open Library</span><span>, and </span><span class="c8">Google Books</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;have endeavored to digitize textual artifacts in different ways for different purposes. </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">As we look at the short history of digitizing books, my question is: where are the book historians? What is the degree of their participation in this ongoing transformation of the book? Is their absence a passive acceptance that only scientists and engineers can determine how we digitize books? While traditional book history scholars may have lacked necessary technological resources in the past, by combining book history expertise with digital humanities technical knowledge, I have theorized a new approach to book digitization practices developed through prototyping. </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">Another important absence to note from all of the previously mentioned collections boasting millions of scanned texts and hundreds of terabytes of files are digital representations of toy and movable books, 3D renderings of bookbindings, or really anything outside a narrowly defined, really stereotyped, canonical sense of a &quot;book,&quot; as anything other than flat pages of texts and perhaps images. Why might the current practices of digitizing books be problematically reaffirming canon at the expense of texts which are, recognizably, books, but which do not take this restricted form? </span></p>
    <h2 class="c12" id="h.u8jtz5xygw2w"><span class="c20">Defining Key Terms</span></h2>
    <p class="c6"><span>In order to examine these questions and assumptions, it is necessary to define key terms. One of the most useful guides in the history and use of the material book is Amaranth Borsuk&rsquo;s </span><span class="c8">The Book</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(2018), which was written as part of MIT&rsquo;s Object Lessons series. As a book artist and book history scholar, Borsuk is uniquely qualified to give an overview on the material form, and I build my argument on her foundational structure. </span></p>
    <h3 class="c2" id="h.3s8620du08f1"><span class="c14">Book and Codex </span></h3>
    <p class="c6"><span>Borsuk first defines how the word book is used in common vernacular. &ldquo;[T]he term </span><span class="c8">book</span><span>&nbsp;commonly refers interchangeably to both medium and content, regardless of our acculturation to the codex.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;She defines the codex as &ldquo;a single object &hellip; whose name comes from the Latin for &lsquo;tree trunk.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Borsuk elaborates, &ldquo;The language we use for the codex suggests its corpus&hellip; The </span><span class="c8">book block</span><span>, those paper pages we read consist of </span><span class="c8">signatures&hellip;</span><span>&nbsp;Stacked and bound in covers, the codex becomes a rectangular volume with a </span><span class="c8">spine&hellip;</span><span>&nbsp;The hardbound codex puts the book block to bed in </span><span class="c8">covers</span><span>.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Therefore, the term book can be used to refer to both the textual content and the material codex form, the side-bound grouping of leaves that can be opened to two facing pages and surrounded by a cover.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">&nbsp;It is necessary to first define the standard book in order to then define a book that deviates from the standard.</span></p>
    <h3 class="c2" id="h.27fglkknjszk"><span class="c14">Nonstandard Book Objects</span></h3>
    <p class="c6"><span>I borrow Lisa Gitelman&rsquo;s term, non-standard book-object,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;hereafter written as nonstandard book object, to generate a subcategory of books that fit the definition of book, but vary in such a way that there is a notable distinction from the canonical sense of the book. In </span><span class="c8">The Book</span><span>, Amaranth Borsuk identifies Ulises Carri&oacute;n&rsquo;s distinction between standard and nonstandard book objects. &ldquo;The books of bookshops and libraries&rdquo; are &ldquo;accidental container[s] of &hellip; text&rdquo;, but books concerned with materiality may be &ldquo;non books, anti books, pseudo books, quasi books, concrete books, visual books, conceptual books, structural books, project books, statement books, instruction books,&rdquo; or &ldquo;bookworks.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Borsuk elaborates, &ldquo;&lsquo;In a bookwork&rsquo; by Carri&oacute;n&rsquo;s definition, &lsquo;the message is the sum of all the material and formal elements.&rsquo; The bookwork, thus, engages in a critique of the book and an exploration of its affordances&hellip;. It represents a conceptual approach to bookmaking, and one that relies on the viewer&rsquo;s interaction with the object to make meaning.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;In all of these cases, however, the terms are only given to books that would now be considered &ldquo;high art.&rdquo; I prefer the term nonstandard book object as I believe it is more inclusive of books made by craftspeople, not artists, as well as books made for popular consumption, like children&rsquo;s books. Though not a perfect distinction, in this case, I distinguish craftspeople as those who are anonymously involved in making a book with artists who are given proper attribution.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">I do, however, believe that the arguments made for artist&rsquo;s books can be equally applied to nonstandard book objects.</span></p>
    <p class="c6 c17"><span>&ldquo;So what do artists&rsquo; books have to teach us about a path forward for the book? As close engagements with its material shape, they serve a dual purpose: first, they offer a great variety of formats that can carry the name &lsquo;book,&rsquo; proliferating the objects to which we can apply the idea and reminding us of the deep history of formal experimentation with the material text; and second, the features of the book they explore and exploit link them to digitally mediated books, which share many of the same concerns.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">This clarification is important to both encourage representation of nonstandard books when using the inclusive term &ldquo;book&rdquo; and to recognize what is and what is not a digital book.</span></p>
    <h3 class="c2" id="h.esu0nu2qpoqb"><span class="c14">Touch-and Feel Books, Interactive/Movable Books, and Treasure Bindings</span></h3>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">Included in this umbrella term, I want to highlight the three main types of books that I will be studying: touch-and-feel books, interactive/movable books, and treasure bindings. Touch-and-feel books are books with sensory interactions augmenting the book, particularly pasted textures that the reader can feel and associate with words printed on the page. Interactive/movable books are books that require manual interactivity or include automatically moving parts. Interactive elements might include pull tabs, spinning disks (volvelles), or lift-the-flaps while automatic movables are usually pop-ups that are triggered through the opening of a page. Treasure bindings are books bound in precious metals, ivory carvings, or gemstones. It is important to recognize that these nonstandard book objects are all categorized by their material attributes rather than their subject genre. </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>Though artist&rsquo;s books have been studied at length in academia,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;these other nonstandard book objects have not been studied thoroughly, especially in comparison to each other. However, many existing arguments about artist&rsquo;s books can also be applied to the books I have selected to study. &ldquo;Several key themes that recur throughout artists&rsquo; books of the twentieth century: spatiotemporal play, animation, ... and interactivity&hellip;. Artists&rsquo; books continually remind us of the reader&rsquo;s role in the book by forcing us to reckon with its materiality and, by extension, our own embodiment.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt10" id="ftnt_ref10">[10]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Additionally, Borsuk notes that focusing on materiality is focusing on the interface, or the space at which interaction occurs. &ldquo;By bringing its interface into focus, they draw our attention to a deeper history of mutation and play with book form.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt11" id="ftnt_ref11">[11]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Furthermore, Borsuk connects how studying nonstandard book objects reveals new understandings of digital books. &ldquo;As we have seen, artists&rsquo; books provide a useful touchstone for thinking about digital books because they are fundamentally interactive, tactile, and multisensory: the reader must manipulate them to experience their full effect.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt12" id="ftnt_ref12">[12]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;With this in mind, we must question, can digital books replicate interactivity?</span></p>
    <h3 class="c2" id="h.b7413ef33kqc"><span class="c14">(Critical) Digitization, Adaptation, Remediation, and Replica</span></h3>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">I argue that there are indeed ways for a book to be digitized that replicate more of a book than just text and illustrations. I use the term digitization as a term that encompasses all approaches to make a virtual version of a material object. </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>Digital humanists in particular are invested in defining the process and product of digitization. In </span><span class="c8">The Emergence of Digital Humanities</span><span class="c0">, Steven E. Jones asserts, </span></p>
    <p class="c6 c17"><span>&ldquo;What does &ldquo;digitization&rdquo; mean, really? Many seem to think of it &hellip; as the dematerializing and transporting of analog objects (books, say) as pure disembodied information, online, up to the cloud, over into the adjacent but invisible digital dimension: atoms &lsquo;blown to bits.&rsquo; &hellip; Of course, the digital humanities is in a position to challenge this metaphor, to educate the public according to a very different model, as DH practitioners know firsthand that the process is, in fact, highly recursive; is usually designed for two-way exchanges between analog and digital objects, from physical to digital and back again, designed with preservation of, and access to, archival originals built in.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt13" id="ftnt_ref13">[13]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">Digitization, then, is a specific type of translation from a material, physical object to a digital form. Jones highlights the role of digitization in digital humanities projects. </span></p>
    <p class="c6 c17"><span>&ldquo;Turkel has argued that his fellow historians should begin to think of their work less in terms of the digitization and more in terms of transduction. Turkel&rsquo;s focus is on the importance of original material artifacts, but he points out that text transcription and optical imaging of documents &lsquo;are only two of a nearly infinite number of possibilities for digitization&rsquo; (288). He then cites smell (because it has so often been the clich&eacute;d non-digitizable attribute of paper artifacts) as something that may actually someday be captured and replicated in digital surrogates. Meanwhile, digital humanities scholars have already &lsquo;greatly expanded our sense of what the humanities can be&rsquo; by working through problems in digitization and raising new questions as a result. But &lsquo;what can be converted from analogue to digital can always be converted back into various analogue forms.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt14" id="ftnt_ref14">[14]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">Jones also argues for why digitization is necessary work, especially in terms of book digitization.</span></p>
    <p class="c6 c17"><span>&ldquo;Data are already attached to, already wrapping, the physical artifact (book, manuscript...), which is to say the thing is marked by the record of its history, in total, as it has made its way through the world, and those data are merely captured, perhaps augmented, and transformed by digitization. These data include its appearance, its markings, any text it bears. The transformation is not really a one-way trip, at least not from the point of view of [those] who engage with the artifact and its surrogates. Digitization of physical things is about enriching and extending the data ... reveal[ing] more explicitly their hybrid nature as both physical and data things, artifacts and their analog and digital representations and networked relationships.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt15" id="ftnt_ref15">[15]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>While we have so far discussed digitization as a translation or transduction, two other key terms are very valuable in this discussion: adaptation and remediation. Adaptation references adapting content to a new environment, and remediation discusses the process of repeating content in a new medium. I expand on the theories of adaptation as found in </span><span class="c8">Theory of Adaptation</span><span>&nbsp;and remediation as defined in </span><span class="c8">Remediation: Understanding New Media </span><span>to investigate how a book designed to be touched and felt can be translated to an app devised for a touchscreen. As Bolter and Grusin observe in </span><span class="c8">Remediation: Understanding New Media</span><span>, &quot;[R]emediation does not destroy the aura of a work of art; instead it always refashions that aura in another media form.&quot;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt16" id="ftnt_ref16">[16]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Therefore, even though the materiality is different, the sense of play is the aura preserved. As Siobhan O&#39;Flynn notes in </span><span class="c8">Theory of Adaptation</span><span>, &quot;the rapid evolution of interactive forms and practices and the variants of intermedial experiences of these adaptations foreground how accelerated innovations in future adaptations to digital platforms will likely be.&quot;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt17" id="ftnt_ref17">[17]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">In the first project, I explore how these practices work specifically for adapting touch-and-feel books to touchscreen.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>I consult and add to theories from digital humanities and media studies to more specifically address access digitization models. While most people are familiar with mass book digitization projects are projects that aim for quantity, like Project Gutenberg, Google Books, and the Internet Archive Open Library, media studies scholar Mats Dahlstr&ouml;m coined the term &ldquo;critical digitization&rdquo; to discuss projects that focus on quality. As Dahlstr&ouml;m compares critical digitization to mass digitization, he points to the selection process, focusing on what makes documents unique, maximizing metadata, and treating documents as material artifacts instead of focusing only on linguistics. &ldquo;Therefore, critical digitization is qualitative in the sense that it concentrates on what is unique and contingent in the documents.... In consequence, then, critical digitization normally has to develop project-specific practices and tools, tailoring them to the qualities of the documents in the particular collection.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt18" id="ftnt_ref18">[18]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;This is a central part of my argument: that in focusing mass book digitization projects on quantity, they have missed many nonstandard book objects, and that it is up to digital humanists to develop project-specific practices and tools based on the books&rsquo; unique qualities. In the second project, I experiment and appropriate virtual reality technology to create 4D volumetric captures of pop-up books.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>Finally, I extend existing theories of digital preservation from digital humanities to consider multiple possibilities of using 3D technologies. For example, Stuart Robson, Sally MacDonald, Graeme Were and Mona Hess suggest in </span><span class="c8">Digital Humanities in Practice</span><span>&nbsp;that &quot;A 3D model may be used in a display as a surrogate for the real thing, when, for example, a real museum object is out on loan or away for conservation. 3D models and prints open up the possibility of creating exact replicas, which can &#39;stand in&#39; for fragile objects, offer handling opportunities, help demonstrate how an object was used or generate museum replicas for sale.&quot;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt19" id="ftnt_ref19">[19]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;The authors are careful though to clarify how 3D printed models act as replicas or surrogates. &quot;Certainly, there is currently no way to fully replicate the nonvisual information gained from physically handling the object; the sense of its weight, its warmth, the texture of its surface, its smell.&quot;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt20" id="ftnt_ref20">[20]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;These possibilities span from benefits for curators to patrons and helped me generate other ideas about 3D printing for touch exhibits, which are extremely valuable for visually impaired patrons who cannot access the artifacts otherwise. By aiming for open access in digital humanities, making the 3D model openly available for others to print or modify for instructional purposes will also change the course of how we share scholarship. In my third project, I use photogrammetry to generate a 3D model and then a 3D printer to print a tactile replica of a treasure binding.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">In addition to setting a framework of terminology, it is also crucial to historically contextualize how these products and processes developed.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c12" id="h.3jui4i2aqje8"><span class="c20">Book History (BH) and Digital Humanities (DH) History </span></h2>
    <p class="c6"><span>There are multiple intersecting timelines from book history and digital humanities that have not yet been collated in one space, like Bush&#39;s memex in 1945 and Busa&#39;s </span><span class="c8">Index Thomisticus</span><span>&nbsp;in 1949, the </span><span class="c8">Project Gutenberg</span><span>&nbsp;website in 1994 and the </span><span class="c8">William Blake Archive</span><span>&nbsp;website in 1996, and the </span><span class="c8">Internet Archive Open Library</span><span>&nbsp;in 2006 and the </span><span class="c8">Digging into Big Data</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;grants in 2009. It is important to look at these events side by side to consider them in points of a larger ecology of &ldquo;book&rdquo; history rather than as isolated events due to sparks of genius. </span></p>
    <h3 class="c2" id="h.7owxuq8h0925"><span class="c14">1945- Memex</span></h3>
    <p class="c6"><span>In 1945, Vannevar Bush wrote an essay in the Atlantic, proposing a revolutionary reading machine. &ldquo;A memex is a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt21" id="ftnt_ref21">[21]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;New media theorist, Terry Harpold, explains, &ldquo;Memex was always, above all, a thought experiment: that is&mdash;a reversal of that term seems justified here&mdash;an experimental application of a model of thought and its record. Bush is less interested in the engineering details than in forecasting the promise and heuristic of a new kind of mental furniture&hellip;&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt22" id="ftnt_ref22">[22]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Many parts of Bush&rsquo;s speculative design are now realized: hyperlinks, cover flow view, the desktop, cloud computing, suggested readings, shared annotations, and more. The Memex is such an important part of book digitization history because it helps us theorize how the relationships between reading and the material apparati could be improved by automation.</span></p>
    <h3 class="c2" id="h.4shom4dg47rg"><span class="c14">1949- Index Thomisticus</span></h3>
    <p class="c6"><span>Another important speculation in the history of the book was Busa&rsquo;s question if computing could aid in a categorical tag and search function in a large text corpus. Susan Hockey outlines the &ldquo;History of Humanities Computing&rdquo; in the 2004 edited collection </span><span class="c8">Companion to Digital Humanities</span><span class="c0">. </span></p>
    <p class="c6 c17"><span>&ldquo;In 1949, an Italian Jesuit priest, Father Roberto Busa, began what even to this day is a monumental task: to make an </span><span class="c8">index verborum</span><span>&nbsp;of all the words in the works of St Thomas Aquinas and related authors, totaling some 11 million words of medieval Latin. Father Busa imagined that a machine might be able to help him, and, having heard of computers, went to visit Thomas J. Watson at IBM in the United States in search of support&hellip;. His team attempted to write some computer software to deal with this and, eventually, the lemmatization of all 11 million words was completed in a semiautomatic way.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt23" id="ftnt_ref23">[23]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>Busa was very methodical and detail-oriented, wanting not just an alphabetical list, but a way to search nouns, participles, verbs, homographs, and their related statistics. &ldquo;The project took over thirty years to complete and endures as one of the earliest and most ambitious projects in the field that is now called digital humanities, with Busa since renowned as the founding father of the field.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt24" id="ftnt_ref24">[24]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;The </span><span class="c8">Index Thomisticus</span><span>&nbsp;project is considered the first digital humanities project likely due two things: first, a focus on using technology to answer a humanistic question, &ldquo;What themes emerge in these biblical writings?&rdquo; and second, the highly collaborative nature of content expertise (Busa) and format expertise (IBM and the women punchcard operators).</span><sup><a href="#ftnt25" id="ftnt_ref25">[25]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;The texts were translated into 56 volumes, then made available on a CD-ROM, and are now available online.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt26" id="ftnt_ref26">[26]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;This project truly set the precedent for how first-wave digital humanists approached book digitization. </span></p>
    <h3 class="c2" id="h.sbit9gx4ypia"><span class="c14">1994- Project Gutenberg</span></h3>
    <p class="c6"><span>Founder of Project Gutenberg, Michael Hart (B.S. Human Computer Interactions), was one of the earliest humanities and social sciences scholars to have access to computers. In 1971, he digitally transcribed the Declaration of Independence; after that, he realized that there were many works in the public domain that could be shared electronically, so he started a digital library by typing works from the Bible, Homer, Shakespeare, and Mark Twain. Project Gutenberg first joined the world wide web in 1994. Project Gutenberg now has over 54,000 plaintext, HTML, and PDF documents. &ldquo;[T]he Project Gutenberg philosophy treats text as liquid that can reflow into the reader&rsquo;s mediating vessel of choice and encourages those readers looking to replicate print to use the e-text to generate these other forms. The digitization process, however, generally begins with scanning each page of a book and running optical character recognition (OCR) to generate a preliminary text for proofreading.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt27" id="ftnt_ref27">[27]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rsquo;s focus on ASCII renderings of public domain works aims to make the text as accessible and fluid as possible, ignoring its former materiality.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt28" id="ftnt_ref28">[28]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;The most remarkable part of this project is how the ambition of one person inspired the mission of so many others to volunteer and contribute their time and efforts to make more reading materials available.</span></p>
    <h3 class="c2" id="h.u8xsjgr36mke"><span class="c14">2004- Google Books</span></h3>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">Larry Page, computer scientist and co-founder of Google, saw the potential of Project Gutenberg and the Internet Archive and wanted to advance digitization on a massive, more rapid scale, so he started Google Print, now known as Google Books. The speed and quality required technological innovation. Borsuk notes, </span></p>
    <p class="c6 c17"><span>&ldquo;The project began manually in 2002, with Page and Marrisa Mayer &hellip; timing the duration it took to flip through a three-hundred-page volume and determining they would need to improve scanning technology to reduce the forty minutes to a more manageable time frame. By 2015, that figure had jumped to six thousand pages an hour thanks to Google&rsquo;s proprietary technology, which uses a motorized cradle, four cameras, a foot-pedal trigger, and software that compensates for the curvature of the page. Most of Google&rsquo;s public scans focus on the text itself and are compressed to grayscale images to reduce file size and optimize OCR.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt29" id="ftnt_ref29">[29]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>This complex amalgam of hardware (cradle, cameras, foot-pedal trigger) and software (page uncurving and optical character recognition), made it possible for Google Books to scan over 30 million books. Borsuk further defines Google&rsquo;s process and mission: &ldquo;Google ... emphasizes text in the interest of indexing, searchability, and easy access. Offering images of the text at a reduced file size, it reminds us that the book is an object, but deemphasizes its particulars--the ultimate goal of Google&rsquo;s book scanning initiative remains fattening its search engine.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt30" id="ftnt_ref30">[30]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;This project is highly contested for multiple reasons: first, the Author&rsquo;s Guild fought and lost a lawsuit because they did not want their work freely available on the Internet. But I think, more than that, the concern is not that the books are digitized, but rather that a corporation owns all of that data, which translates to sociocultural and capital power. Digital humanists, then, must keep in mind the source of their technology and maintain good relationships with the sources of the material artifacts.</span></p>
    <h3 class="c2" id="h.da8mv1ykd5ya"><span class="c14">2006- Internet Archive Open Library</span></h3>
    <p class="c6"><span>Another mass digitization project that combines the openness of Project Gutenberg and the centralized technological process of Google Books is the Internet Archive&rsquo;s Open Library. While the Internet Archive started archiving web pages in 1996, a decade later, the project included digitizing material artifacts as well. Borsuk discusses how the project&rsquo;s history informed their new project and how the mission expanded over time. &ldquo;The Internet Archive, founded by MIT graduate Brewster Kaule in 1996 to archive the ephemeral pages of the World Wide Web,... has, over time, become a clearinghouse of media, including film, text, audio, software, and magazines, with the goal of offering permanent future access to this work in digital format.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt31" id="ftnt_ref31">[31]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>Borsuk notes how the skills in archiving websites became useful in digitizing library books and how the Open Library wanted to use their scans. &ldquo;In addition to out-of-copyright works, the Internet Archive&rsquo;s Open Library initiative aims to create a web-based finding aid for every book ever written, including a scan, if available.&rdquo; While this may seem similar to Google Books&rsquo; project&rsquo;s aim to expand search results, the Internet Archive is a nonprofit organization, not a multibillion dollar corporation. However, both Google Books and Internet Archive collaborated with and had the support of many libraries on their projects. &ldquo;Open Library expands the Archive&rsquo;s offerings through a partnership with over one thousand international libraries that allows patrons to borrow scans of in-copyright works and contemporary e-books in those libraries&rsquo; holdings.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt32" id="ftnt_ref32">[32]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;The Internet Archive Open Library &ldquo;approached these artifacts with care&rdquo; to &nbsp;&ldquo;preserve the codex.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt33" id="ftnt_ref33">[33]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;When libraries they were collaborating with did not want their books back, the Internet Archive started a &ldquo;Physical Archive of the Internet Archive&rdquo; in California. In comparison to Project Gutenberg and Google Books, the Open Library takes the most consideration into the virtual representation of the physical artifact and the needs of its readers.</span></p>
    <p class="c6 c17"><span>&ldquo;The Internet Archive&hellip; treats the book as an object, providing high-resolution color scans that show the nuances of the page&rsquo;s surface and include foldout images and marginalia to replicate the book as closely as possible, but it also makes the same book available in multiple digital formats to meet the needs of different readers. With high-resolution scans for download or online use, EPUBs for use with e-readers, and DAISY talking-book format for the visually impaired, the Internet Archive is committed to serving as a digital public library.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt34" id="ftnt_ref34">[34]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>The Internet Archive Open Library is the project most aligned with the idea of open access that is so prevalent in digital humanities. The National Endowment for Humanities (NEH) Office for Digital Humanities (ODH) make their priorities clear and describing where their money goes: &ldquo;Funded digital projects contribute to humanities scholarship that serve carefully-identified audiences, address issues of accessibility and usability, and are designed to be open, replicable, and sustainable.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt35" id="ftnt_ref35">[35]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Digital humanities projects can encompass a wide array of processes and products, but DH scholars have generally proposed three broad categories, or overlapping &ldquo;waves,&rdquo; that make up its history. </span></p>
    <h3 class="c2" id="h.3uljk9cb60lb"><span class="c14">First, Second, and Third Wave Digital Humanities</span></h3>
    <p class="c6" id="h.uzena7nbni55"><span class="c19">Though I have previously mentioned that humanities have been interested in how computing can aid in humanistic inquiry to at least as early as 1949, the field of digital humanities did not solidify as a term and discipline until around 2004. In </span><span class="c19 c8">The Emergence of the Digital Humanities</span><span class="c19">&nbsp;(2014), Steven E. Jones denotes a shift from a focused interest in humanities computing to an established scholarly agenda of digital humanities. &ldquo;The term digital humanities itself was solidified in a collection of essays published online in 2004 and as a hardcover book in 2005 (Blackwell&#39;s Companion to Digital Humanities).&rdquo;</span><sup class="c19"><a href="#ftnt36" id="ftnt_ref36">[36]</a></sup><span class="c19">&nbsp;In </span><span class="c8 c19">Understanding Digital Humanities</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(2012), David M. Berry defines and distinguishes the first two waves of digital humanities projects and then proposes a third &ldquo;computational&rdquo; wave.</span></p>
    <h4 class="c13" id="h.j34o9pk1x7d1"><span class="c18">First wave</span></h4>
    <p class="c6"><span>Berry&rsquo;s </span><span class="c8">Understanding Digital Humanities</span><span>&nbsp;outlines the overlapping goals and outcomes of first-wave digital humanities projects. &ldquo;[T]he first wave of digital humanities work was quantitative, mobilizing the search and retrieval powers of the database, automating corpus linguistics, stacking hypercards into critical arrays.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt37" id="ftnt_ref37">[37]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;It is interesting that he does not distinguish between digital humanities projects pre- and post-internet, but rather all projects that use computing to create large datasets based on material artifacts are included. If it were up to me, I would consider hypercard and pre-internet projects to be zeroth wave, and then start the first wave in the 1990s. Berry continues, &ldquo;[T]he first wave of Digital Humanities scholarship in the late 1990s and early 2000s tended to focus on large-scale digitization projects and the establishment of technological infrastructure.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt38" id="ftnt_ref38">[38]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;This is when many of the digital archives focused on a single author&rsquo;s corpus were started, including the Rossetti Archive (</span><span class="c7"><a class="c9" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.rossettiarchive.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736290171086081&amp;usg=AOvVaw0OiEMOwBclwOXTAybBy8v-">http://www.rossettiarchive.org/</a></span><span>), the Dickinson Electronic Archives (</span><span class="c7"><a class="c9" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.emilydickinson.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736290171086233&amp;usg=AOvVaw3IejFR-uI0mDSS45hrxbxn">http://www.emilydickinson.org/</a></span><span>), The William Blake Archive (</span><span class="c7"><a class="c9" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.blakearchive.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736290171086336&amp;usg=AOvVaw1jrvGCxNvz9U6V5nLV00LV">http://www.blakearchive.org/</a></span><span>), and The Walt Whitman Archive (</span><span class="c7"><a class="c9" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://whitmanarchive.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736290171086473&amp;usg=AOvVaw34TQ01oPeQp3nDIjrGX3UP">https://whitmanarchive.org/</a></span><span>). Berry notes that first-wave digital humanities projects prioritize text analysis, often at the expense of other material data. &ldquo;[T]he first wave of Digital Humanities concentrated, perhaps somewhat narrowly, on text analysis (such as classification systems, mark-up, text encoding, and scholarly editing) within established disciplines.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt39" id="ftnt_ref39">[39]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;This work was a necessary first step, however, in making traditional humanities recognize the value of digital humanities. &ldquo;[F]irst-wave digital humanities involved the building of infrastructure in the studying of humanities texts through digital repositories, text markup and so forth.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt40" id="ftnt_ref40">[40]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;It is because this valuable foundation was created in recognizing the value of computing to create virtual representations of material artifacts that digital humanists could then move on to born-digital materials.</span></p>
    <h4 class="c13" id="h.z3nbw065m731"><span class="c18">Second wave</span></h4>
    <p class="c6"><span>Berry consolidates the shared goals of the second wave of digital humanities projects. &ldquo;The second wave is qualitative, interpretive, experiential, emotive, generative in character. It harnesses digital toolkits in the service of the Humanities&rsquo; core methodological strengths: attention to complexity, medium specificity, historical context, analytical depth, critique and interpretation.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt41" id="ftnt_ref41">[41]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;While access to the digital data allowed for quantitative analysis of materials that already existed in archives, the second wave considered technologies that did not already exist, and works that were not already archived in material form. &ldquo;[T]he current second wave of Digital Humanities &ndash; what can be called &lsquo;Digital Humanities 2.0&rsquo; &ndash; is deeply generative, creating the environments and tools for producing, curating, and interacting with knowledge that is &lsquo;born digital&rsquo; and lives in various digital contexts.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt42" id="ftnt_ref42">[42]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;In this way, I would perhaps distinguish the roles of first-wave DHers as translators and second-wave DHers as toolmakers. Translators are integral in making a text more accessible to a wider audience and toolmakers make new types of work possible. Berry also points out that the second-wave digital humanities pushes us further away from the codex lineage of traditional humanities fields. &ldquo;Digital Humanities 2.0 introduces entirely new disciplinary paradigms, convergent fields, hybrid methodologies, and even new publication models that are often not derived from or limited to print culture.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt43" id="ftnt_ref43">[43]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Finally, Berry recognizes some of the main born-digital materials that the second-wave is so recognized for. &ldquo;[S]econd-wave digital humanities expands the notional limits of the archive to include digital works, and so bring to bear the humanities&rsquo; own methodological toolkits to look at &lsquo;born-digital&rsquo; materials, such as electronic literature (e-lit), interactive fiction (IF), web-based artefacts and so forth.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt44" id="ftnt_ref44">[44]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;One of the most representative projects to come out of second-wave DH is Scalar, &ldquo;a free, open source authoring and publishing platform that&rsquo;s designed to make it easy for authors to write long-form, born-digital scholarship online.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt45" id="ftnt_ref45">[45]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Not only is the tool itself a DH project, but many of the works authored using it are also representative of second-wave DH.</span></p>
    <h4 class="c13" id="h.6vkichurjogv"><span class="c18">Third wave</span></h4>
    <p class="c6"><span>Berry then proposes a third-wave of digital humanities that focuses neither on digitizing materials or creating born-digital materials, but actually understanding the code. &ldquo;[A] third wave of the digital humanities, concentrated around the underlying computationality of the forms held within a computational medium (I call this move a computational turn).&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt46" id="ftnt_ref46">[46]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Berry elaborates, &ldquo;[T]hird-wave digital humanities points to the way in which digital technology highlights the anomalies generated in a humanities research project and which leads to the questioning of the assumptions implicit in such research, for example close reading, canon formation, periodisation, liberal humanism and so forth.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt47" id="ftnt_ref47">[47]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;One great example of third-wave DH is the collaboratively written </span><span class="c8">10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10</span><span>&nbsp;(2012), which focuses on how a single line of code reveals the nuances of how coding languages are written by humans and read by computers.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt48" id="ftnt_ref48">[48]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Berry stresses the need for digital humanists to understand the underlying or back-end code to fully appreciate the front-end results that we see. &ldquo;[T]o understand the contemporary born-digital culture and the everyday practices that populate it &ndash; the focus of a digital humanities second wave &ndash; we need an additional third-wave focus on the computer code that is entangled with all aspects of culture and memory, including reflexivity about how much code is infiltrating the academy itself.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt49" id="ftnt_ref49">[49]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;This history then separates work into either a transformation from material to digital, the creation of born-digital works and tools, or the understanding of the code behind digital works. But what about work that translates from material to digital back to material? </span></p>
    <h3 class="c2" id="h.tt6xbyvbuzup"><span class="c14">Fourth Wave Digital Humanities</span></h3>
    <p class="c6"><span>If the first wave is textual, the second-wave is born-digital, and the third-wave is computational, I argue that the fourth wave of digital humanities is material. In </span><span class="c8">Debates in the Digital Humanities 2016</span><span>, Bethany Nowviskie speculated that &ldquo;book historians [and others] will be the next avid explorers of new digital materialities&rdquo; such as &ldquo;3D fabrication,&rdquo; &ldquo;physical computing,&rdquo; and &ldquo;augmented reality&rdquo; accessing &ldquo;the loop from the physical to the digital to the material text and artifact again.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt50" id="ftnt_ref50">[50]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;I argue that Nowviskie&rsquo;s prediction has come true: the fourth wave of digital humanities is material; that is, it is tactile, analog, embodied, and felt.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt51" id="ftnt_ref51">[51]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;In </span><span class="c8">The Emergence of Digital Humanities</span><span>, Jones writes, &ldquo;humanities research is ultimately based on significant material things: texts, works of art, cultural artifacts. The special category of things known as primary objects&mdash;manuscripts on paper or vellum, printed texts in books, cultural artifacts and works of art, electronic files&mdash;are the basis of almost all humanities scholarship.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt52" id="ftnt_ref52">[52]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Fourth-wave digital humanists do not just study material artifacts; they make them. Some examples include DB Bauer&rsquo;s 3D-printed &ldquo;Touchable Speculation,&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt53" id="ftnt_ref53">[53]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Tiffany Chan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Adventures in 3D Print(mak)ing,&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt54" id="ftnt_ref54">[54]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Helen Burgess&rsquo; physical computing project in which a Twitterbot is paired with a thermal printer,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt55" id="ftnt_ref55">[55]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;and Amaranth Borsuk&rsquo;s laser-cut </span><span class="c8">Abra Codex</span><span>.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt56" id="ftnt_ref56">[56]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;In each case, the artifact was digitally designed and physically materialized to make an argument. I propose that making things should be emphasized in academia, both as we learn in the process, &ldquo;critical making,&rdquo; and also let the things we make become &ldquo;prototypes that argue.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt57" id="ftnt_ref57">[57]</a></sup></p>
    <h2 class="c12" id="h.oerbx8i4e9y4"><span class="c20">Makeademia: Learning By Making</span></h2>
    <p class="c6"><span>I propose the term &ldquo;makeademia&rdquo; to describe the broad practices of making in academia. Not only would this include &ldquo;critical making,&rdquo; but also many metamaterial pedagogical making practices like making comics to understand comics, making films to understand film, or making interactive fiction to understand interactive fiction. The term critical making is a portmanteau of the abstract &ldquo;critical thinking&rdquo; and the material &ldquo;making.&rdquo; In &ldquo;Thinking as Handwork: Critical Making with Humanistic Concerns,&rdquo; the authors mention that critical making &ldquo;lean[s] toward the &hellip; &ldquo;the relative value of processual acts versus evocative objects.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt58" id="ftnt_ref58">[58]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Yet in their article, &ldquo;How A Prototype Argues,&rdquo; Alan Galey and Stan Ruecker argue for the impact of the object: &ldquo;[T]he creation of an experimental digital prototype [can] be understood as conveying an argument about designing interfaces.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt59" id="ftnt_ref59">[59]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;And so my umbrella term incorporates all forms of making in academia, valuing the process and product as ways to learn. </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>The fields of book history and digital humanities in particular both emphasize the value of making. Amaranth Borsuk writes, &ldquo;I &hellip; believe that a thorough understanding of what a book is and can do requires a certain amount of hands-on engagement.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt60" id="ftnt_ref60">[60]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Borsuk elaborates on the history of bookmaking: &ldquo;[William] Blake wrote, illustrated, printed, hand-colored, and sold his own books as a cost-saving measure, but also because he viewed each element as central to the work&rsquo;s expressive power.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt61" id="ftnt_ref61">[61]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;In a Marxist lens, teaching students to make their own books is teaching them to seize the means of the production of communication. Galey and Ruecker connect the making practices of book history to digital humanities. &ldquo;Like design, the field of book history offers a perspective on the ethos of thinking through making which informs much digital humanities research and pedagogy generally.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt62" id="ftnt_ref62">[62]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;They also recognize that it is necessary to think of making ecologically, to consider the networks of materials and laborers involved. &ldquo;The digital humanities must not lose sight of the design of artifacts as a critical act, one that may reflect insights into materials and advance an argument about an artifact&rsquo;s role in the world.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt63" id="ftnt_ref63">[63]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;In particular, they note that the artifacts generated in digital humanities projects should be considered scholarly arguments in and of themselves, not just artifacts to then be written about. &ldquo;By recognizing that digital objects&mdash;such as interfaces, games, tools, electronic literature, and text visualizations&mdash;may contain arguments subjectable to peer review, digital humanities scholars are assuming a perspective similar to that of book historians who study the sociology of texts.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt64" id="ftnt_ref64">[64]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;This is the position I take in this project; that is, while it is important for me to write about what I learned from making, it is equally important that what I make be considered in part of the evaluation.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>Guides to making books are abundant, and there are established standard practices and materials, like sewing signatures for a book block or using polyvinyl adhesive (PVA) glue for archival purposes. Yet artist&rsquo;s books often subvert expectations and norms of what is a book. Coding likewise has standards, yet the best way to learn is by tinkering. Jones notes, &ldquo;I find that hands-on experimentalism, even a willingness to maybe break something in order to see how it works, remains part of coding culture.&quot;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt65" id="ftnt_ref65">[65]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Jones notes how prevalent the spirit of making is ingrained in digital humanities.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>&ldquo;Digital humanities scholars don&rsquo;t only write articles and books (though they do that, too): They contribute to research and to theory by writing code, digitizing archival materials,... building ... databases, creating new software tools for analysis and visualization,... all of which means getting their hands dirty digitizing, archiving, designing, coding, analyzing, and publishing digital objects of diverse kinds. For the past decade, DH making has also taken inspiration from the wider so-called Maker movement outside the walls of the academy. This has meant building not only software but hardware things, and, despite the suspicion of many that DH is instrumentalist, these things have been more often than not created in the spirit of investigation and creativity rather than utility.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt66" id="ftnt_ref66">[66]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>This entire project demonstrates the value of this statement: this project combines making with writing, incorporates coding and digitizing, and is made to materialize prototypes that serve to speculate solutions to problems. Jones notes that this making goes beyond typing characters on a keyboard; &ldquo;an important feature of the movement is its emphasis on building and creative hacking, involving programming and design of digital tools and Websites, yes, but also a significant amount of soldering and wiring, and some sewing.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt67" id="ftnt_ref67">[67]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;For the bookmaking aspects of this project, I used an Xacto blade to cut foam core, used a manual guillotine to cut pebbled leather fabric, used multiple softwares to design all of the files, used a cutting machine to cut out intricate designs in cardstock, used the sketch pen feature of the same cutting machine to draw yard lines on astroturf, used a paintbrush to paint heat-activated beakers, used an awl to punch holes in cotton paper, used a needle and thread to sew signatures, used a glue brush and PVA glue to adhere my book, and used a ball-peen hammer to repousse sterling silver. Digital humanities making can learn a lot from using the same tools, technologies, and processes as crafting and a lot about audience and presentation from design. This argument is best made in the collaboratively authored book, </span><span class="c8">Digital_Humanities</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(2012). The authors (a designer, a book artist, a media theorist, a director of a digital mapping platform, and a lab director) describe the connection between digital humanities and design.</span></p>
    <p class="c6 c17"><span>&ldquo;Not every digital humanist will become a designer, but every good digital humanist has to be able to &ldquo;read&rdquo; and appreciate that which design has to offer, to build the shared vocabulary and mutual respect that can lead to fruitful collaborations. Understanding the rhetoric of design, its persuasive force and central role in the shaping of arguments, is a critical tool for digital work in all disciplines.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt68" id="ftnt_ref68">[68]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>Though not explicitly argued, I interpret this to mean that digital humanists can and should attempt good design, even if they never become experts. Digital humanists can also greatly enhance their projects through collaboration. &ldquo;The field of Digital Humanities may see the emergence of polymaths who can &ldquo;do it all&rdquo;: who can research, write, shoot, edit, code, model, design, network, and dialogue with users. But there is also ample room for specialization and, particularly, for collaboration.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt69" id="ftnt_ref69">[69]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;The polymath is an intimidating figure, one who is an expert in advanced technical praxis as well as theoretical underpinnings. As an alternative, I proffer the &ldquo;makeademic,&rdquo; an academic who makes. There are no expectations of breadth or depth of expertise; a makeademic need only make something to claim the title. When a makeademic encounters a problem, they speculate a solution and make something that articulates their argument.</span></p>

    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">In this section I identify the key problems that this project hopes to address as well as the solutions I propose. These problems are both abstract and concrete; how does copyright affect the project? how can the project be realized on a small budget? what if there are no pre-existing standards, processes, or technologies specifically made to address a specific problem? and what if the artifacts cannot be accessed?</span></p>
    <h3 class="c2" id="h.7graycvya5jc"><span class="c14">Copyright</span></h3>
    <h4 class="c13" id="h.o6k77xjq0icb"><span class="c18">Problem 1: Copyright makes digitization of newer books difficult/litigious</span></h4>
    <p class="c6"><span>As Mark Sample points out in his chapter &quot;Unseen and Unremarked On: Don DeLillo and the Failure of the Digital Humanities&rdquo; from the first iteration of the </span><span class="c8">Debates in the Digital Humanities </span><span class="c0">series in 2012, there are many difficulties in creating digital humanities projects with 21st-century copyrighted artifacts. Sample writes, </span></p>
    <p class="c6 c17"><span>&quot;[T]he fact remains that the most promising, rewarded, or recognized work in the digital humanities has centered upon texts and artifacts in the public domain. The typical approaches to the digital humanities function quite well for medievalists, Renaissance scholars, Victorianists, nineteenth-century Americanists, or even modernists. Nearly everything scholars in these fields study is in the public domain and has been subjected to numerous and competing forms of digitization. But what if you study a living novelist, whose works are most decidedly copyrighted?&quot;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt70" id="ftnt_ref70">[70]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">Sample continues, </span></p>
    <p class="c6 c17"><span>&quot;Unless one is willing to infringe on copyright, break a publisher&rsquo;s DRM, or wait approximately four generations when these authors&rsquo; works will likely fall into the public domain, barring some as of yet unknown though predictable act of corporate America Congress, the kind of groundbreaking work being done on seventeenth-, eighteenth-, nineteenth-, and even twentieth-century literature simply will not happen for DeLillo and his contemporaries.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt71" id="ftnt_ref71">[71]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">While I agree with Sample&rsquo;s assertion as it pertains to his project, I considered if the same were true for me. I want to create digitizations of touch-and-feel books and architectural pop-up books, but they are all too new to be in public domain. What solution could I find?</span></p>
    <h4 class="c13" id="h.4hu6kbatu1dq"><span class="c18">Solution 1A: Create my own touch-and-feel book</span></h4>
    <p class="c6"><span>Since current public domain only extends to works created before 1923 and the earliest cited touch-and-feel book is Dorothy Kunhardt&rsquo;s 1940 </span><span class="c8">Pat the Bunny</span><span>, I recognized the need to create my own touch-and-feel book. The term touch-and-feel I believe does not do justice to all of the interactions that can be included in these types of books. </span><span class="c8">Pat the Bunny</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;for example included textures to be felt, but also a mirror to look in, a scent to smell, a cloth flap to lift, a cutout to insert a finger, and a miniature book-within-the-book to read. With this interactivity as inspiration, I created a touch-and-feel book with an astroturf texture, a textured flick football, miniature cheer pom-poms, a 3D printed goal post, a dry erase surface and marker, a pull-tab-activated paper lamp, a miniature book in a Tyvek envelope scented with a paperback perfume, heat- and cold-activated-painted lab supplies, and a small speaker that plays back a pre-recorded sound.</span></p>
    <h4 class="c13" id="h.xblbcrmc59f"><span class="c18">Solution 1B: Create my own pop-up book</span></h4>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">While movable books with lift the flaps, spinning disks, and pull tabs have been around for quite some time, more elaborate highly dimensional pop-ups are a recent innovation. I therefore needed to create my own pop-up book to demonstrate the need for a spatiotemporal transformations digitization process. I designed, cut, and assembled a pop-up book that included pop-ups of landmarks on UF&rsquo;s campus: stadium, bell tower, meditation center, bat house, and butterfly rainforest.</span></p>
    <h3 class="c2" id="h.2qbfglxoeitv"><span class="c14">Digitization Expenses</span></h3>
    <h4 class="c13" id="h.3jopxpkuu9z"><span class="c18">Problem 2: Digitizing Is Expensive</span></h4>
    <p class="c6"><span>Digitization can be a costly process for many reasons. In Dan Pence&rsquo;s 2003 presentation, &ldquo;Ten Ways to Spend $100,000 on Digitization,&rdquo; he cites the cost of equipment, scanning labor, and post-processing labor as major variables that determine the price of digitization.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt72" id="ftnt_ref72">[72]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Furthermore, as Daniel Cohen and Roy Rosenzweig explain in their book, </span><span class="c8">Digital History: A Guide to Gathering, Preserving, and Presenting the Past on the Web</span><span>&nbsp;(2005), digitization is measured both by &ldquo;the &lsquo;density of data&rsquo; captured&rdquo; i.e. &ldquo;the resolution for images,&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;the breadth or depth of information gathered in each sample.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt73" id="ftnt_ref73">[73]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;There is no one-size-fits-all solution to best resolution for images. While a 72 pixel per inch resolution is better for quick web brower viewing purposes because it takes less time to load, a download for normal printing sizes would be better at 300 dots per inch. Some projects may even call for scanning at 2400 dots per inch to enhance and reveal details, but the scanning time will be significantly longer and the file size will be tremendously larger. Cohen and Rosenzweig recognize, &ldquo;Capturing more information and sampling more frequently makes digitizing more expensive. It takes longer to gather and transmit more complete information, and it costs more to store it.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt74" id="ftnt_ref74">[74]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;They continue, &ldquo;Technological advances have gone much further in improving our ability to make faithful digital surrogates than they have in reducing the costs of doing so.&rdquo; This is certainly a concern and creates inequitable access. As Harpold theorizes in </span><span class="c8">Ex-Foliations: Reading Machines and the Upgrade Path</span><span class="c0">, </span></p>
    <p class="c6 c17"><span>&ldquo;Because technical innovation in popular computing is driven more by the allure of expanding markets than by something so quaint as a sense of responsibility to historical continuity, commercial discourses of the upgrade path will inevitably promise consumers new and more satisfying interactions, and encourage them to see the older ones as outmoded or no longer relevant.&rdquo; </span><sup><a href="#ftnt75" id="ftnt_ref75">[75]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">Digital humanists must remain cognizant of the capitalist and consumerist developments of technology and intervene as makers and users. Yet, despite these costs and concerns, digitization can still enhance access, even if the access to digitize is limited. Cohen and Rosenzweig defend this position: &ldquo;If digitization is imperfect, difficult, and expensive, why bother? Because digitization offers stunning advantages.&rdquo; One of the ways that digital humanists can make an intervention in this problematic situation is to &ldquo;hack&rdquo; or reappropriate technologies for their own purposes, whether software or hardware.</span></p>
    <h4 class="c13" id="h.6pwbwukzpqx"><span class="c18">Solution 2A: Experiment with lower-cost technologies (CodePen, Website Hosting)</span></h4>
    <p class="c6"><span>In my first project, I discuss how books can be adapted into apps. The process of making an app is however expensive in terms of labor and fees. An app is specific to a platform, like Android or Apple, so you have to write different code for each if you want to make it available on both platforms. Furthermore, an Apple Developer license is $99 per year, which is required if you want to distribute your app on their App Store. Additionally, apps must continually be updated as Apple updates its software, meaning continuous programming labor is required. Instead, my project experiments with lower-cost technologies, creating an interactive, touchscreen website instead of an app. There are many free websites that teach the elements of coding, but I specifically used w3schools.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt76" id="ftnt_ref76">[76]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;There are also many free code editors, but for this project I used CodePen because it is free, people share code snippets, and you can view the results of code changes in real time.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt77" id="ftnt_ref77">[77]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;There are also many great ways to host websites, though this will usually have an annual hosting cost as well as a one-time cost of a domain. Because I already have a personal website domain and hosting service through GoDaddy, I was able to create a subfolder to host this project, but most academics recommend Reclaim Hosting, which has a personal plan for $30 per year.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt78" id="ftnt_ref78">[78]</a></sup></p>
    <h4 class="c13" id="h.7svmbx9vgp64"><span class="c18">Solution 2B: Experiment with lower-cost technologies (Microsoft Kinect, free beta software)</span></h4>
    <p class="c6"><span>In my second project, I attempt to digitize movable books. The most successful movable book digitization project is Penn State&rsquo;s Virtual Movable Books site.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt79" id="ftnt_ref79">[79]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;This project was partially funded by a $45,000 National Endowment for the Humanities Digital Humanities Start-Up Grant and was developed by a team of over 40 people.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt80" id="ftnt_ref80">[80]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;The project required expensive cameras for high-resolution scanning of fragile historical movable book artifacts, a software developer to create a Unity-based application, and continuous web hosting support. Without anywhere close to that budget, I experimented with technology like the Microsoft Kinect (~$200) and free beta software and hosted the results on the free platform, Sketchfab.</span></p>
    <h3 class="c2" id="h.ldt5hieni1ou"><span class="c14">Capturing 3D Transformations of Pop-Up Books</span></h3>
    <h4 class="c13" id="h.590upud5r9un"><span class="c18">Problem 3: Lack Digitization Standards for 3D Transformations of Pop-Up Books</span></h4>
    <p class="c6"><span>The lack of digitization standards for cultural heritage translates to each project manager determining their own processes. Some digital collections have photographed a single stage of a movable book while others photograph multiple stages but do not animate them together in any meaningful way. The Penn State Virtual Movable Books site was the most innovative approach to digitizing a movable book, creating a playable applet, but it requires the Unity Web Player plugin.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt81" id="ftnt_ref81">[81]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;My approach is less expensive and only requires a team of one.</span></p>
    <h4 class="c13" id="h.pvk253oudrkg"><span class="c18">Solution 3: Appropriate from other technologies to create an experimental workflow (Sketchfab, Mimesys VR volumetric capture)</span></h4>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">In my second project, I discuss how neither 3D nor 3D models can accurately represent a pop-up book that transforms over space and time. Instead, I explored virtual reality technologies to create a volumetric capture. TimeSlice Films developed their own setup to create a volumetric capture using 53 GoPro cameras. Though no costs were provided, if the cheapest GoPro camera is about $400, I calculate that the minimum cost of the array was $21,200. I instead experimented, reappropriating a free beta software of virtual reality meetings developed by MimesysVR. The software requires a Microsoft Kinect for PC (~$200) to create short 4D volumetric captures that can then be hosted on the free modeling platform, Sketchfab. Sketchfab also automatically makes any of the models on their site available for augmented reality using their mobile app or for virtual reality with applications like Google Cardboard.</span></p>

    <h3 class="c2" id="h.6cevcepiqu8c"><span class="c14">Access to Rare Artifacts</span></h3>
    <h4 class="c13" id="h.jsw2goowhfmz"><span class="c18">Problem 4: Many rare books are inaccessible to researchers and museum-goers</span></h4>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">It is a well-known problem in academia that access to rare artifacts can make or break a research project. Many material book artifacts that researchers would be interested in studying are inaccessible because there is only one copy and someone else is studying it; or else that copy is very far away; or else that copy is behind a glass case; or else that copy is currently in conservation and preservation; so on and so forth. Treasure bindings in particular are so rare that there are only a few scattered across the globe and curators are reticent to let anyone get close and touch them.</span></p>
    <h4 class="c13" id="h.eijvtsjhqgxp"><span class="c18">Solution 4A: Create my own treasure binding</span></h4>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">If I wanted to study how a treasure binding could be digitized, I was going to have to create my own treasure binding. I designed the structure and gathered materials to repousse silver and affix crystals to mimic historical treasure binding designs, usually a central larger figure with four smaller figures in each corner. Though most historical treasure bindings use religious iconography, I rely on contemporary iconography of the Gator Nation fandom.</span></p>
    <h4 class="c13" id="h.9dwrsu883evs"><span class="c18">Solution 4B: Create accessible digitizations with 3D models and digital fabrication</span></h4>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">Once I had my own treasure binding that I could handle and scan, I used the educational licensed version of the photogrammetry application, Agisoft Metashape, to stitch together a range of photographs taken around the book. The application automatically generates a virtual 3D model with photorealistic textures that can be shared on Sketchfab. I then &nbsp;used the free software, Autodesk Meshmixer, to prepare the virtual model for 3D printing, which if printed with plastic in hollow form, can cost less than $100.</span></p>

    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">In this chapter, I introduce the reader to the creative histories and educational potentials of touch-and-feel books. I then discuss how creators are adapting print books to mobile applications that use the functions of a touchscreen device in a playful way. I next discuss the benefits of making children&rsquo;s books in both my pedagogy and my research. Then, I provide documentation on the steps I took to create my own touch-and-feel book, explaining my design decisions. Next, I outline my process of creating an interactive touchscreen book experience, and how the digital book reflects or is modified from the print book. Finally, I discuss the benefits of the print and digital versions coexisting.</span></p>
    <h3 class="c2" id="h.85lm0yfgmm6g"><span class="c14">ABCD: Accessible books via critical digitization</span></h3>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">This chapter starts with an introduction of how books are currently mass digitized and proposes critical digitization to create low-cost, high-impact digitization projects. I then provide a media history of interactive/movable books, including pull-tabs, pop-ups, and other forms of paper engineering. Next, I reflect on my efforts to digitize historical movable artifacts from the Baldwin Library of Historical Children&rsquo;s Literature. I also elaborate on how cultural heritage institutions are using technology to provide access to their artifacts. I then outline the process I designed to create a complex pop-up book. I follow this process with a discussion of my experimental workflow using virtual reality technologies to create a 4D volumetric capture of the pop-up book I made and share how to view and interact online or in virtual or augmented reality. Finally, I address the mutual benefits of digital humanists collaborating with cultural heritage institutions.</span></p>
    <h3 class="c2" id="h.yipb23nvxj4s"><span class="c14">Re(p)lic(a)</span></h3>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">This chapter begins with a look at how cultural heritage institutions specifically use 3D virtual and printed models to enhance their collections. I then provide a media history of a specific rare book artifact, the treasure binding, to emphasize its importance in book history and the problems of its inaccessibility for research. I next reflect on my experience creating a 3D virtual and printed model of a treasure binding in the Walters Art Museum. I then outline the process I created to make my own treasure bound book with velvet, silver, and crystals. The next section outlines the modes I test and the ultimate results in using photogrammetry to create my own 3D virtual and printed models. This chapter concludes with a discussion of the value of blending the past (book history) with the future (digital humanities).</span></p>

    <h2 class="w3-padding-16 w3-text-light-grey" id="adaptation">Chapter 2: AdAPPtation From Touch-N-Feel to Touchscreens</h2>
    <p class="c6"><span>In his 1993 article, &ldquo;The Places of Books in the Age of Electronic Reproduction,&rdquo; Geoffrey Nunberg asserts in a parenthetical aside &ldquo;(It is unlikely that virtual reality will soon be developed to the point of being able to render </span><span class="c8">Pat the Bunny</span><span>&nbsp;in all its sensory complexity).&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt82" id="ftnt_ref82">[82]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Nearly three decades later, academia&rsquo;s understanding of the electronic reproduction of books has traversed the realm of speculation to become commonplace, in the forms of eBooks and apps, though the ideas for book digitization in virtual and augmented realities still leaves ample room for development. What Nunberg likely could not have anticipated is the near-ubiquitous role of mobile computing via touchscreens, especially after the first iPad was made available in 2010. What is notable about his selection of </span><span class="c8">Pat the Bunny</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;as the exemplar for an electronically irreproducible book is that Random House developed an iPad app version in 2011. I will agree with Nunberg, however, that &ldquo;all its sensory complexity&rdquo; is not captured. I argue, rather, that like any adaptation from one medium to another, some attributes are gained and others are lost in translating a material codex to digital code. A fair bit of experimentation is involved in making books, and a lot can be learned in the process of making as well as allowing the prototype to serve as an argument. That being the case, I argue in this chapter that bookmakers should anticipate the possibilities of digitization in their creative process. To demonstrate the potential of this argument, I have created a working prototype of a touch-and-feel book and a touchscreen digitization to show the benefits of coexisting digital and print versions.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c12" id="h.fqwqaw2x4rlh"><span class="c20">What are Touch-N-Feel Books?</span></h2>
    <p class="c6"><span>In order to discuss how to adapt a material book to a digital form, we must first understand the history and benefits of book materiality. In </span><span class="c8">The Book </span><span class="c0">(2018), Amaranth Borsuk introduces her readers to the importance of the book in early childhood development.</span></p>
    <p class="c6 c17"><span>&ldquo;The book would, at first glance, seem to be an object about which we all possess essential knowledge. It is, for many children, among the first playthings we encounter, whether in the soft cloth books of contrasting colors and bold patterns often kept in the crib to stimulate vision, or a little later in board books like Dorothy Kunhardt&rsquo;s </span><span class="c8">Pat the Bunny</span><span>&nbsp;(1940), with contrasting textures to activate our sense of touch and simple words and phrases to help us imagine a world arranged neatly into narratives.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt83" id="ftnt_ref83">[83]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>The relevance of materiality is especially pronounced in the subset of interactive/toy books known as &ldquo;touch-and-feel&rdquo; books. In the </span><span class="c8">Oregon Library Association Quarterly</span><span>&rsquo;s cheekily-titled 2010 issue, &ldquo;Print is Dead! Long Live Print!&rdquo;, Patrick Goodman outlines some of the form&rsquo;s media history: &ldquo;Touch&rsquo;n&rsquo;feel books are printed materials ... that offer tactile interaction between the toddler and the storyline. Possibly the most widely known title in this sub-genre of board books is Dorothy Kunhardt&rsquo;s classic </span><span class="c8">Pat the Bunny</span><span>&nbsp;(1940), wherein the reader leads the toddler in an intersensory romp through the every day goings-on of a middle class family&rsquo;s home.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt84" id="ftnt_ref84">[84]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c8">Pat the Bunny</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is clearly designed for smaller, less dexterous hands, as evidenced by the easily-manipulable spiral binding, the small hole cut out for a child-sized finger, and a mirror barely two inches in diameter. The reader is guided through feeling the soft texture of the bunny vs. the scratchy surface of &ldquo;Daddy&rsquo;s face,&rdquo; asked to lift a cloth flap to play peekaboo and learn to turn the pages of a miniature book within the book, observe their reflection in a mirror and play dress-up by wearing &ldquo;Mummy&rsquo;s ring,&rdquo; and even stop to smell the flowers. Goodman continues, </span></p>
    <p class="c6 c17"><span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sensory integration theory provides a conceptual foundation explaining the interaction between sensory systems to produce functional outcomes&rsquo; (Pizur-Barnekow, Kraemer, &amp; Winters, 2008). This theory drives the idea that by appealing to a wide base of senses, humans are able to gain greater information about a subject or object. For toddlers, who are right at the beginning of exploring and understanding the world around them, it seems practical to offer them a wider panoply of information through multiple sensory stimuli in order to give a more enriched understanding of the object.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt85" id="ftnt_ref85">[85]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>There are many reasons that adults design these sensory lessons to be learned through books and not just toys. First, interactive books help to form the connection early on that reading is fun and can be playful. Second, these books highlight the primacy of words in our society, connecting written language to abstract concepts as well concrete elements. Third, sensory books connect learning new things through books. In contrasting the notion that print is dead, Borsuk asserts, &ldquo;[In 2015], children&rsquo;s board books [sales rose] 7.4 percent. Parents, apparently, see the benefit of these tactile objects for learning and developing motor skills.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt86" id="ftnt_ref86">[86]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;I argue that the more a book emphasizes its materiality, the less likely it is to be considered expendable.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">Tactile books are not just effective tools through which to develop motor skills and connecting sensory stimuli to concepts; they also become an early building block in how to learn. Goodman connects early exposure to sensory books as beneficial in later education.</span></p>
    <p class="c6 c17"><span>&ldquo;It would then seem plausible that new students who have been regularly exposed to touch&rsquo;n&rsquo;feel books since infancy would enter into the multimedia educational environment with a strong fundamental understanding of the necessity to experience a subject from a variety of ways. By learning at a very early age that objects can be manipulated with a wide array of senses in order to gain better understanding, children will hopefully enter the multimedia classroom with the skills necessary to enrich their personal educational experiences beyond what is being delivered by the teacher (Gogate et al., 2001).&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt87" id="ftnt_ref87">[87]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">While education still relies on print books like textbooks, students are also learning by watching slideshows and videos, listening to lectures and podcasts, and participating in hands-on experiments. Educating young readers on the multisensory experience will almost certainly help them approach multimodal learning as they move forward in their schooling.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>I argue that it is important to recognize how many innovations in the material book form occur in books intended for young readers. Scholars like Stefan Klima, Johanna Drucker, and Amaranth Borsuk have enumerated the wonders and possibilities of artist&rsquo;s books to subvert our expectations of the material codex. But many of their arguments about the elevated art form of artist&rsquo;s books are equally relevant to touch-and-feel/interactive books that are often considered less prestigious (perhaps because their intended audience is predominantly children). For example, consider how Borsuk&rsquo;s description works equally well for both forms. &ldquo;These works interrogate the codex, calling into question how books communicate and how we read, using every aspect of their structure, form, and content to make meaning. Engaging with the book as an idea brings its material form back into the conversation in ways that can be productive, exciting, perplexing, and at times problematic.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt88" id="ftnt_ref88">[88]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;We must also consider how book artists view their medium. Julie Chen and Clifton Meader (qtd. in Borsuk) inquire and respond, &ldquo;What is a book? A book is an experience&hellip;. A book starts with an idea. And ends with a reader.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt89" id="ftnt_ref89">[89]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Touch-and-feel book creators are hyper-aware of their reader/audience, as both the adult reading the text to the toddler/child and the child interacting with the material book. Interactive books can also be experiential in digital formats, especially when interacting with a touchscreen.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c12" id="h.uybrvrtm6ygt"><span class="c20">What are Book App Adaptations? </span></h2>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">Though not a ubiquitous practice, interactive books are sometimes adapted into app form. An app is a mobile application that works on a touchscreen device, like a smartphone or a tablet. Apps differ from websites in that they are platform-specific rather than browser-agnostic. Therefore, it requires a lot of work to make an app available, as it must constantly be updated to match changing developer requirements and it must be reconfigured for multiple platforms like iOS and Android. As in other forms of book digitization, many standard books are made available as virtual &ldquo;pages&rdquo; to be read on e-readers/tablets, in the form of eBooks, iBooks, or ePUBs. In this case, there is usually one central app, like iBooks, which serves as a library of multiple virtual books. This is different from a book app, which is independent. But book apps borrow many skeuomorphic design principles from other eReading apps. The best way to understand book apps is to first understand e-readers and eBooks and then note their distinctions.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>In </span><span class="c8">The Book</span><span class="c0">, Amaranth Borsuk outlines how e-readers have shaped our understanding of &ldquo;reading&rdquo; and &ldquo;book&rdquo;:</span></p>
    <p class="c6 c17"><span>&ldquo;Digital reading devices existed prior to e-readers, but none has challenged our definition of the book in quite the same way or raised as much of an outpouring of print nostalgia on one hand and digital futurist rhetoric on the other. These devices--flat, lightweight screens that can show us any volume in a whole library of texts--look much different from the one most of us picture when we hear the word </span><span class="c8">book</span><span>: a stack of paper sheets printed on both sides, bound on one end, and encased between covers.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt90" id="ftnt_ref90">[90]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>Virtual libraries of books are problematic as they do not &ldquo;contain&rdquo; books, but rather proprietary forms of data that can be given and taken away, as was the case in 2009 when Amazon mass-deleted illegal digital editions of George Orwell&rsquo;s </span><span class="c8">1984</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c8">Animal Farm</span><span>&nbsp;from everyone&rsquo;s devices.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt91" id="ftnt_ref91">[91]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;eBooks disrupt our notions of collecting and ownership, as all eBooks are truly owned by the companies and rented by the reader with digital rights management (DRM) software.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>These eBooks are generally reformatted as plain vanilla ASCII text, allowing the content to resize to fit different screen sizes, but making citing page numbers much more difficult. Borsuk describes the standardized eBooks as &ldquo;simply liquid text,&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt92" id="ftnt_ref92">[92]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;and elaborates, &ldquo;As contemporary publishers seek to embrace digital technology, we find ourselves at a moment in which the form and content of a work often bear little relation to one another&hellip;.When books become content to be marketed and sold&hellip;, this historic relationship between materiality and text is severed.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt93" id="ftnt_ref93">[93]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;This is why I argue that book digitization must never be a one-size-fits-all approach, but rather a thoughtful process in which the digitizer deliberates as to what aspects are most relevant to be replicated, and which can be left behind. While a text-only format may be more accessible or transmittable for the majority of readers, in many cases, meaning is lost without page size and layout, typeface, and other paratextual clues. Borsuk explains why both approaches have value.</span></p>
    <p class="c6 c17"><span>&ldquo;Text&rsquo;s digital life untethers it from any specific material support, making it accessible through a variety of interfaces (including the computer, cell phone, tablet, and dedicated e-reader), each of which influences our reading. We will also consider contemporary approaches to digital reading that, rather than offering up a crystal goblet, invite us to trace our finger along text&rsquo;s rim and make it sing: drawing attention to the interface to explore and exploit the affordances of the digital.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt94" id="ftnt_ref94">[94]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>Digital books present opportunities to skeuomorphically represent their physical antecedents or embrace their virtuality. In comparing digital books to the long history of material forms of writing like the clay tablet, the scroll, and the codex, Borsuk highlights the paradox of requiring a codexical format in a digital screen: &ldquo;And though they lend themselves to infinite scrolling text, our digital reading environments maintain codex-like features, from bookmarking and page turning on-screen.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt95" id="ftnt_ref95">[95]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Perhaps we have not yet reached the digital book in it&rsquo;s own form, but are rather still remediating all of the mediums we already know. As Borsuk argues, &ldquo;[Digital reading device interfaces] aim to create a seamless reading experience built on the affordances of the codex and the behaviors we have adapted from it... borrow[ing] a number of the physical book&rsquo;s structures, </span><span class="c8">remediating</span><span>&nbsp;them in the digital environment while flattening the codex to the dimensions of a thin wax tablet.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt96" id="ftnt_ref96">[96]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;In addition to distinguishing between the virtual and the material book, it is also necessary to distinguish why the touchscreen revolutionized eBooks in a way that desktop computing did not. Book app designer and scholar, Cynthia Nugent, explains,</span></p>
    <p class="c6 c17"><span>&ldquo;Interactive digital stories have been available on the web and as CD-ROMs for nearly thirty years, but the iPad&rsquo;s introduction in 2010 brought one critical difference: the touchscreen. It makes the iPad intuitively playable by even very young children (Buckleitner 2011, 36&ndash;37). When the finger touches the screen, the device detects electricity in the human body.... Using the finger directly on the screen allows for &ldquo;continuous interplay&rdquo; (Schwebs 2014, 9) and intuitive, meaningful, and relatively unimpeded engagement, while a computer mouse, which you have to learn how to use, always keeps the player at a remove from what is happening on the screen. With the touchscreen, players may tap, drag, and pinch and spread their fingers; some gestures effectively mimic the sensation of touching a real object.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt97" id="ftnt_ref97">[97]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">The intuition to which Nugent refers comes from more immediate visual feedback. In using a traditional monitor/keyboard/mouse setup, our eyes are trained to look at the computer screen and we are expected to operate the mouse independently without looking at our hand. The touchscreen removes a layer of distance so that the user can simultaneously watch their digits (fingers) and their digital screen. In particular, the swipe gesture most often used to turn the pages of a virtual book resembles the swiping motion of turning the pages of a glossy magazine, and translates well to a glossy touchscreen.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>Digital books are uniquely capable of offering possibilities for multimodal augmentations like videos and hyperlinks. Borsuk notes, &ldquo;Those Expanded Books set the tone for the early stage of e-books and e-readers by remediating print and taking advantage of digital storage to add extras to the text, a trend that continues in &lsquo;enhanced e-books,&rsquo; book apps that include ancillary features like performances by well-known actors and related archival material.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt98" id="ftnt_ref98">[98]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;But book apps have the greatest possibility for extra augmentations because they do not just tap into front-end functionality, but back-end coding as well.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>Some advanced book apps can tap into the capabilities of the hardware and software to enhance the story. &ldquo;[A] number of authors and artists are using the medium to create immersive cinematic and game-like reading experiences that take advantage of the digital space opened up by this technology and demand a more expansive definition of the book.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt99" id="ftnt_ref99">[99]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;In his 2011 TED talk, &ldquo;A next-generation digital book,&rdquo; software developer Mike Matas showcased how data visualizations can be enhanced by designing a book app for the iPad, including pinch and fold videos and using user input from the microphone to cue the animation.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt100" id="ftnt_ref100">[100]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Cynthia Nugent specifies many of the ways that children&rsquo;s book apps have incorporated the built-in technological capabilities of the iPad to their storytelling. Nugent outlines how some app designers, like Nosy Crow, have used the built-in sensors and hardware of the iPad to immerse their readers.</span></p>
    <p class="c6 c17"><span>&ldquo;In their </span><span class="c8">The Three Little Pigs</span><span>&nbsp;(2011), blowing into the iPad&rsquo;s microphone when the wolf is huffing and puffing initiates an animation of the straw house falling down. In their </span><span class="c8">Snow White</span><span>&nbsp;(2013), the player can soothe a crying infant back to sleep by rocking the iPad. The iPad&rsquo;s camera simulates a mirror in other fairy tales by showing a live view of the player&rsquo;s face in a mirror frame (</span><span class="c8">Cinderella</span><span>&nbsp;2011).... With narrative-related interactions such as these, &ldquo;readers enter the fictional world as participants becoming [&hellip;] part of the fiction as well as its co-authors&rdquo; (Frederico 2014, 148).&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt101" id="ftnt_ref101">[101]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>By adapting the classics with which many readers are already familiar, the app designers of these children&rsquo;s stories could focus their efforts on retelling the story by emphasizing the affordances of this new medium. A few other examples of book app adaptations that use the affordances of the iPad are </span><span class="c8">The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore</span><span>&nbsp;iPad app (2011) and the (now defunct) </span><span class="c8">Press Here</span><span>&nbsp;iPad app (2012). Technically, the </span><span class="c8">Fantastic Flying Books</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;app is actually an adaptation of the Moonbot Studios film and was then adapted into a picturebook, but it bears inclusion here because it belongs to a transmedia storytelling collective all authored by the same group. The app makes suggestions for gestures like swiping with wavy arrows that blink in and out or the corner of the page folding over to be turned. Likewise, the reader is given visual cues as to which objects to tap for interactivity with a subtle strobe effect. Taking advantage of the accelerometer, the app allows the reader to fly the main character, Morris Lessmore, through the air by tilting the screen. The app also takes advantage of the iPad&rsquo;s Photo roll by saving images made out of alphabet cereal by the reader. The interactivity is limited, but the original story is still retold and preserved in this new form. </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>The </span><span class="c8">Press Here</span><span>&nbsp;app, on the other hand, varies greatly from the book. The original </span><span class="c8">Press Here</span><span>&nbsp;book by Herv&eacute; Tullet (2011) invites the reader to &quot;press here and turn the page.&quot; The real magic happens in the liminal space between page turns. On the next spread, a second dot has appeared and the text reads &quot;Great! Now press the yellow dot again.&quot; We now have built anticipation and expectation. The reader expects something to happen again, but is in suspense as to what will happen. The implied action at the page turn has been theorized by Lawrence Sipe and Anne Brightman in their article, &quot;Young Children&rsquo;s Interpretations of Page Breaks in Contemporary Picture Storybooks.&quot; They argue, &quot;The page turns in a picturebook, also known as page breaks, thus have a complex semiotic significance (Sipe, 1998a). A picturebook is not only a slow-motion series of presented verbal and visual images; the brief hiatus as we turn the page can be used meaningfully by the author and/or illustrator in various ways.&quot;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt102" id="ftnt_ref102">[102]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;I would argue that no one is more aware of this potential than Herv&eacute; Tullet. The readers not only associate the fact that their interaction caused the change on the next page spread, but are also complimented, as if the results were user-created rather than a power of the book. While there is technically nothing to feel except a glossy piece of paper, there are still many ways that </span><span class="c8">Press Here</span><span>&nbsp;engages with the sense of touch. However, instead of cutaneous perception, some of </span><span class="c8">Press Here</span><span class="c0">&#39;s interactions would be described as kinesthetic: at various moments the text suggests &quot;Try shaking the book,&quot; &quot;tilt the page to the left,&quot; and &quot;try blowing on them.&quot; This is another example of play as mimicry. The book simulates physics and gravity in the implied movement from interactivity, but of course the next page will demonstrate the same visual whether or not you follow directions. </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>The app does not replicate, but rather the app uses the familiar yellow, red, and blue dots in a series of games that use randomization, the accelerometer, touch gestures, and animations to create interactivity. Rather than a digital reproduction of the text and illustrations, the app consists of 15 different types of interactive opportunities in a range from </span><span class="c8">paidia</span><span>, unstructured play to </span><span class="c8">ludus</span><span>, rule-based games. The app is clearly designed for the user to learn through playing with the iPad, especially the simulation of physics in the sub-app aptly titled, </span><span class="c8">Press Here</span><span class="c0">. Though there are technically two iterations, the first instantiation I encountered is the most faithful adaptation of what happens when you &quot;tilt the page to the left&quot; when reading the print book. Utilizing the iPad&#39;s built in accelerometer, the programming makes it possible to actually watch the dots fall to the bottom of the screen as you tilt the iPad to visualize an instantaneous animation, rather than inferring it in the page turn. Instead of connecting the concepts of words to results as in the book, the player connects bodily actions with results, still helping with visuo-haptic learning, but in a different way. The app contains no signals like page-turning animations or any other reference that this app is an adaptation of a print codex form.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">Borsuk makes some of these connections between touchscreen apps and touch-and-feel books. </span></p>
    <p class="c6 c17"><span>&ldquo;[S]ome writers are developing books specifically for the affordances of networked, screen-based devices, incorporating video, sound, animation, and complex layouts&hellip; that play with the material metaphor of its interface.... The iPad, for example, is a touch interface that recognizes specific gestures hard-coded into the operating system: currently tap and double-tap, 3-D press, drag, flick, swipe, pinch, touch and hold, shake, and multi-finger gestures. These gestures are so ingrained into users&rsquo; expectations of the iPad and iPhone, Apple&rsquo;s developer rules mandate their use and restrict alternate mappings of these behaviors to promote the company&rsquo;s ethos of intuitive interfaces and accessibility. This brings us back to where we began, with </span><span class="c8">Pat the Bunny</span><span>, a book that teaches us how to read and how to touch. In exploring haptic modalities of reading, these digital books, too, foreground the reader&rsquo;s role in bringing a book to life--whatever its physical form.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt103" id="ftnt_ref103">[103]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>The comparison of the 1940 </span><span class="c8">Pat the Bunny</span><span>&nbsp;book by Dorothy Kunhardt and the 2011 </span><span class="c8">Pat the Bunny</span><span>&nbsp;app by Random House yield fruitful results in the potential for book apps to be considered book digitizations. The book relies on augmenting beyond paper and ink with items like faux fur, sandpaper, reflective material, cloth, and even scent. In the book, we see Judy modeling an action, </span><span class="c8">pat</span><span>, with all five fingers outstretched and are then told to replicate. The reader first uses sight to quickly perceive the outline of the white bunny but it is only through the lateral motion of patting that she can verify that the bunny is soft with a furry texture. On a later spread, we see Judy &quot;feel Daddy&#39;s scratchy face.&quot; She is now only using one finger, so the verb </span><span class="c8">feel</span><span>&nbsp;is modeled differently than </span><span class="c8">pat</span><span class="c0">. We are also given the descriptive indicator that whatever we are about to feel is &quot;scratchy.&quot; The reader first locates the patch on Daddy&#39;s face, identifying the edges, size, form, and color of Daddy&#39;s beard. Then, with the pad of the fingertip, the reader slowly feels the gritty texture of the beard (which is actually black sandpaper). This is certainly an affordance of the material codex that an iPad app cannot replicate and indeed there is no mention of patting the bunny or feeling Daddy&#39;s face in the app. Instead, the first screen in the app corresponds to the third spread in the book. Judy plays peekaboo with Paul and then we are told to play peekaboo. There is an illustration of a shirt, two arms, and a bit of neck as a visual clue that Paul is beneath the blue rectangular cloth, but it is only after exploring motions and lifting the flap that Paul&#39;s face is revealed. To play, then, is not to feel or to pat, but to freely experiment. </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>In the 2011 </span><span class="c8">Pat the Bunny</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;iPad app, the peekaboo scene is more dynamic. If you touch any pixel of the cloth covering Paul&#39;s face, the cloth is digitally animated to flap up and again reveal Paul&#39;s smile now accompanied by an audible giggle. But, unlike in the print book, if you lift the flap again, Paul has changed. He is now sticking his tongue out at you and you hear the raspberry sound. The next time, he smirks and snickers, and the next time, he gasps, eyebrows high and mouth wide open. The developers at Random House are conscious of the inability to include material add-ons, but instead redefine play as a dynamic interaction utilizing the iPad&#39;s abilities for randomization, animation, and sound. </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>The only scene of the </span><span class="c8">Pat the Bunny</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;app that requires more interaction than just one touch is making ducks swim back and forth in the pond. You must use your finger to swipe and drag the ducks across the screen, and this action helps the reader perceive the surface properties of the iPad. The screen is smooth and likely cool (unless the battery is overheating) but the friction of your fingers along the glass awakens your thermoreceptors (the friction generates heat) and your nociceptors (it&#39;s a bit painful if you do it for an extended period of time). Though this is an unintentional consequence rather than the prescribed interaction, it is still experiential learning. </span></p>
    <h2 class="c12" id="h.n8smhnqy7j4d"><span class="c20">Learning By Doing: Making Children&rsquo;s Books in University Courses</span></h2>
    <p class="c6"><span>&ldquo;I &hellip; believe that a thorough understanding of what a book is and can do requires a certain amount of hands-on engagement.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt104" id="ftnt_ref104">[104]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;I wholeheartedly endorse and regularly practice this sentiment. I was fortunate to learn the principles of bookmaking and design in my own coursework from book artist, book arts curator, and professor, Ellen Knudson.The knowledge and skills I developed during this fine arts course translated to my humanities coursework and pedagogy. For example, Professor John Cech encouraged us to make books, so I made a dessert pop-up book and a dessert alphabet book in our </span><span class="c8">Writing Childhood</span><span>&nbsp;course. Professor Kenneth Kidd and Curator Suzan Alteri encouraged us to consider new modes of data visualization in our </span><span class="c8">Into the Baldwin</span><span>&nbsp;course, so I made a movable book that charted the color schemes, opening sentences, and different forms of movables of the pop-up </span><span class="c8">Cinderella</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;books in the Baldwin Library of Historical Children&rsquo;s Literature. The more book projects I made, the more I realized how useful the design constraints of the codex really are for generative thought. </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">I have since incorporated bookmaking into the courses I design, and students are constantly astonished by what they learn in the process of making their own books, especially children&rsquo;s books. Making a book instead of writing an essay requires the maker to consider the materiality, visual design, and become more attuned to their audience. When students build paper prototypes, they ask questions like, &quot;What page size is best for children&#39;s picturebooks?&quot; or &quot;How can the turn of a page be used to create suspense in a graphic memoir?&quot; One student reflected,</span></p>
    <p class="c6 c17"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Creating a comic taught me that it is not that hard to draw at a very amateur level. If one can draw lines and write text, one can create a comic. I found my creativity to be sparked by the idea of illustrating a memory and pacing it out as an effective medium for storytelling, and that inspiration helped me draw better than I thought I could, and it made the experience incredibly fun. I drew inspiration from comic books and wimmelbooks by incorporating a full-page panel in the middle of the story to slow the pace down.&rdquo; -RSG</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">Students might be initially intimidated when asked to make a book if they compare their work to most books today; it is therefore imperative to remind them that those books are made by a team: the author, illustrator, designer, editor, printer, and binder. As an instructor, I do my best to alleviate their pressure to make something perfect or sellable, but rather guide them in the idea of making a proof of concept or a prototype that argues, so that students feel emboldened to create.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">The various components of bookmaking help students develop various skills, competencies, and approaches. Tinkering helps students get reacquainted with problem-solving. Bookmaking also encourages students to tap into their creativity and consider design. One student noted that materiality of prototyping did not need to be expensive, and that making a book for a course jumpstarted an interest in continuing the project after the class was over.</span></p>
    <p class="c6 c17"><span>&ldquo;If I learned one thing from this course, it is that there is room for creativity in even the simplest of materials. The capacity to create something instructive, entertaining or a mix of the two does not rely on the cost of the materials used. I learned the most when creating my final book project. I would definitely be interested in expanding on it because it was fun for me to make. I can see myself continuing to craft different styles of books.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt105" id="ftnt_ref105">[105]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">Another student reflected on the hands-on approach to bookmaking and how it creates a more direct connection with the intended audience. This student also noted how prototyping a book in the course led to thinking about future iterations.</span></p>
    <p class="c6 c17"><span>&ldquo;One thing that pushed my boundaries was all the crafting! I love words and I love playing with words, but as is evident in my final project, I came to enjoy (slightly) working with my hands to craft an interesting and memorable experience for my reader. Going to the libraries and seeing the different books from the special collections played heavily in some of my design decisions, and I would love to play more with different builds and methods in the future.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt106" id="ftnt_ref106">[106]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>Making books can also help students reexamine their assumptions about media. The process draws their attention to how they consume text. &ldquo;I thoroughly enjoyed all of the hands-on activities that we did during the semester. I would have never considered all these alternative mediums as ways to create books. This class definitely opened my eyes to a new definition of the codex.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt107" id="ftnt_ref107">[107]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Students also recognize that learning how books </span><span class="c8">are</span><span>&nbsp;made ignites creativity to consider other ways that books </span><span class="c8">could be</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;made.</span></p>
    <p class="c6 c17"><span>&ldquo;A big part of this class was creating things and it was the first English class I have taken at UF that gave me as much creative freedom as I wanted. The idea that a book might not be bound by physical space (the interactive fictions we worked with on the computer), might not be bound by a finite space (a series of letters contained within a book), or that it might be something that has moving parts that add new meanings to the text. I knew that some of these aspects of the codex existed prior to taking this class, but I never put all of it together about how meaningful it is to dissect what we know about the construct of books and examine how, as creators, we can move beyond those constraints. The way that we change our definition of books and creative content allows us to create new meaning and interpretations from audiences.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt108" id="ftnt_ref108">[108]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>Asking students to make prototypes also gives them a more comprehensive understanding of the challenges of making, and students come to appreciate the difficulties of making everyday objects. One student noted, &ldquo;In terms of the most satisfying experience, it was really cool to be able to actually hold my 3-D printed model of a book. It may just be a little piece of plastic, but there&rsquo;s just something fulfilling about seeing an actually decent, tangible final product after spending hours repeatedly messing up, tweaking, and restarting my work.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt109" id="ftnt_ref109">[109]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>Finally, there is something particularly satisfying for students about making something that they can show to a wider audience than their professor. Students feel proud of their accomplishments. One student noted, &ldquo;This class was the first time in a long time that I have enjoyed my homework and have been motivated to put in effort. My favorite project by far was creating my own book and after the countless hours that I put in I could not be more pleased with the result.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt110" id="ftnt_ref110">[110]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Another student mentioned how her book garnered attention with her peers. &ldquo;My friends and featured soccer teammates have been asking me to make copies of the little golden book. It has made me incredibly excited that they value something that I put time into making.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt111" id="ftnt_ref111">[111]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">The lessons that come with prototyping and bookmaking are all particularly relevant as I created my own touch-and-feel book. My topic relies on my expertise of the experiences on campus. I designed and made a prototype or proof-of-concept rather than a polished package. I designed the book with a specific audience in mind, any young (or young-at-heart) reader curious about the University of Florida. By experimenting with new materials and technology, I had to design creative solutions to problems as they arose. I was inventive and creative in my design, mixing materials like 3D printed components, the sound electronics from a recordable greeting card, and thermochromic pigments. I challenged our assumptions of books as flat by incorporating depth, creating a compartment for a dry erase marker within the book and designing a field goal on a hinge so that it can lift off the page. In the end, I created a book that I am proud of and eager to share.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c12" id="h.m5bsmmuzdsum"><span class="c20">Creating Welcome to the Swamp Board Book</span></h2>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">As with prototyping any project, a lot of experimentation and trial-and-error was involved in creating my touch-and-feel book. I wanted to design a simple interactive board book that highlighted some of the aspects of campus life at the University of Florida. My design process began with deciding on the content for each page spread. I knew I wanted to highlight the sensory experience, but also keep in mind what interactions could be remediated digitally for a touchscreen experience. In the end, I selected the stadium, the classroom, the library, the laboratory, and the outdoors as the five venues for the book&rsquo;s interactive scenes. In the stadium, the reader could play football and cheer on the team. In the classroom, the reader could write on a dry erase board. In the library, the reader could turn on a lamp, remove the miniature book-within-a-book from the envelope, smell the pages, and read the abridged story. In the laboratory, the reader could change colors with hotter and colder temperatures. And outside, the reader could listen to the bells.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>My inspiration came from many of the books and toys I interacted with as a child. </span><span class="c8">Pat the Bunny</span><span>&rsquo;s use of pasted textures, a miniature book in a book, and added scents inspired me to highlight touch and smell. The Golden Sound Story books and sound greeting cards of my childhood inspired my use of sound. The Write-On/Wipe-Off books and Magic Slate toys I scribbled on endlessly inspired my use of a whiteboard marker. Some more recent interactions that have also inspired my prototype include artists using thermochromic pigments in their artist&rsquo;s books, like Heather Weston&rsquo;s </span><span class="c8">READ (past, tense)</span><span>&nbsp;(2000), Amaranth Borsuk, Kate Durbin, Ian Hatcher&rsquo;s </span><span class="c8">Abra</span><span>&nbsp;(2015), and Yiota Demetiou&rsquo;s </span><span class="c8">To You</span><span>&nbsp;(2019). Jie Qi&rsquo;s </span><span class="c8">Electronic Popables</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(2009) inspired my use of movable paper circuits and her development of Chibitronics made it possible for me to add a light to my design.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">For each page spread, I designed the imagery with a combination of the desktop vector graphics software, Adobe Illustrator, on a Macbook Pro and a free-form vector drawing app for mobile devices, Adobe Illustrator Draw, on an iPad. The layout of each page spread is a flat illustration on the verso (left) side of the page spread and the interactive, dimensional elements on the recto (right) side of the page spread. Initially, I intended to use a premade blank board book, but the additional components I was adding created too much bulk, meaning the pages could not close properly. After researching potential options, I switched to building the pages with foam core covered in cardstock to add the height required, while retaining the rigidity of the page turning, using a lightweight material, and allowing me to print the designs.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;"> <img src="img/w3images/image5.jpg" alt="photo of page spread of Albert and Alberta alligator mascots at the Swamp football stadium and green faux turf with yellow goalpost and pom poms" class="w3-image"> </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">For the first spread, I designed an illustration of the University of Florida mascots, Albert Gator in a football jersey and Alberta Gator in a cheerleading outfit, on the Steve Spurrier Florida Field in the Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. I used Illustrator&rsquo;s pen tool and shape tool to create the entire background. I then used a stylus with the iPad touchscreen and the Adobe Illustrator Draw iOS app to draw the foreground figures. On the recto side, I designed the lines on the football field with Adobe Illustrator and then used the sketch pen functionality of the Silhouette Cameo to draw the design with a white pen onto astroturf material. I then carved into the foam core to create depth and pasted the astroturf rectangle to the bottom. I also used the online 3D modeling software, Autodesk Tinkercad, to design a field goal post that worked on a hinge so that it could be lifted up when open to the page and lay flat when the book was closed. I then 3D printed the goal post and spray painted it yellow and used hot glue to affix it in position. I used a fabric that looked like pebbled leather to construct the flick football and cut some miniature pom-poms and attached small rubber bands so that the reader could wear them to cheer any field goals scored in flick football.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;"> <img src="img/w3images/image24.jpg" alt="photo of page spread of Alberta the alligator mascot in front of a classroom whiteboard and a whiteboard and dry erase marker" class="w3-image"> </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>For the second spread, I designed an illustration of Alberta Gator teaching letters, colors, and shapes at a whiteboard modeled after my classroom in Matherly Hall. Alberta Gator is wearing the recognizable Mr. Two Bits outfit: a yellow button-down shirt and orange-and-blue horizontal-striped tie. On the whiteboard are three icons, a green alligator, a blue butterfly, and a citrus orange.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt112" id="ftnt_ref112">[112]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;For the recto design, I used silver contact paper and adhesive whiteboard vinyl, and then cut out a shape of the foam core to hold a mini dry erase marker.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;"> <img src="img/w3images/image9.jpg" alt="photo of page spread of Albert the alligator mascot at the library and a minizine of the Wonderful Wizard of Oz" class="w3-image"> </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>For the third spread, I designed an illustration of a studious bespectacled Albert Gator sitting at a table and reading a book in the Grand Reading Room of Smathers Library East, Special Collections, 2nd Floor. For the recto design, I used a shiny black vinyl to act as the tabletop. I then designed a pull tab mechanism using metallic gold cardstock to form a half cylinder to resemble a vintage brass table lamp. When the reader pulls the tab, it switches on a miniature Chibitronics LED light sticker that is powered by a coin cell battery hidden inside the foam core and connected with conductive adhesive copper tape. On the table, I adhered a small envelope made out of Tyvek, a durable archival material. Inside is a small printed abridged version of </span><span class="c8">The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</span><span class="c0">. I selected this work to abridge because it is in the public domain and the imagery is so vivid and a great source of inspiration. I designed this miniature book with Illustrator and Draw, printed on thin copy paper, and bound with a simple stitch with binder&rsquo;s thread. I then used a &ldquo;paperback&rdquo;-scented rollerball to give the paper a recognizable smell. </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;"> <img src="img/w3images/image36.jpg" alt="photo of page spread of Alberta the alligator mascot in the science lab and color changing beakers" class="w3-image"> </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">For the fourth spread, I designed an illustration of Alberta Gator wearing a lab coat and safety goggles and holding a beaker in a science lab. For the recto design, I designed and cut out beakers and flask shapes out of acetate using Illustrator and the Silhouette Cameo cutting tool. I then combined a clear glossy varnish with thermochromic pigments from SolarColorDust. I used a triple heat-activating pigment that turns from red to orange at 85 degrees Fahrenheit and from orange to yellow at 95 degrees Fahrenheit. I also used a cool-activating pigment that turns from colorless to blue at 72 degrees Fahrenheit. In addition, I mixed this with yellow acrylic paint as well as magenta acrylic paint so that I could have a yellow-to-green and a magenta-to-purple reaction. I applied these pigmented paints to the acetate beakers and flasks and attached them to the page. (The fastest ways to demonstrate the color changes are to stick the book near the freezer to activate the cool, or use a blowdryer to activate the heat).</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;"> <img src="img/w3images/image41.jpg" alt="photo of page spread of the backs of Albert and Alberta alligator mascots walking under the French Fries sculpture toward the bell tower and a swinging bell" class="w3-image"> </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>For the fifth and final spread, I designed an illustration facing the back of Alberta and Albert holding hands at a highly recognizable location on campus: in between the Computer Science Engineering building and the Marston Science Library, underneath the </span><span class="c8">Alachua</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;sculpture affectionately known as the &ldquo;French Fries,&rdquo; with the Century Tower peeking through the pillars. When the book is opened to this page spread, it activates the speaker which plays 15 seconds of the Century Tower bells ringing. On the recto page is a paper bell connected by a metal brad, allowing the reader to swing the bell.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c12" id="h.9vyw7a2fgyb5"><span class="c20">Designing an Interactive Touchscreen Book in HTML/CSS/ JavaScript using CodePen</span></h2>
    <p class="c6"><span>Though I had originally intended to design an iOS app like Random House&rsquo;s </span><span class="c8">Pat the Bunny</span><span>, I recognized the limitations of my own technological expertise and resources, as the Apple Developer rules are stringent and costly. Instead, I designed my digital interactive book as a website targeted for mobile devices like iPads. I also consulted with UF alum software developer, Thomas Storey, who was instrumental in helping me bring this project to fruition.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt113" id="ftnt_ref113">[113]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;I developed this website as a prototype to showcase one possible avenue for remediating interactive analog components for a touchscreen. As a novice coder, I relied heavily on the site CodePen.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt114" id="ftnt_ref114">[114]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;The platform is so beneficial for learning coding because you can search public snippets of code with functionalities similar to your needs, &ldquo;fork&rdquo; (copy) the code, and then make modifications and see the changes manifest in real time. These three coding languages, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, work in tandem to create interactive web pages. HTML, hypertext markup language, provides the nuts and bolts, like text and images, of the static elements of the website. CSS, cascading style sheets, provide the style, like font and color, to the elements. JavaScript provides all of the action and functionality, turning a site from static to dynamic.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">This interactive touchscreen book can be broken down into six projects: the overall book, the interactive field goal, the interactive whiteboard, the interactive library, the interactive science lab, and the interactive bell. The adaptation takes advantage of some of the abilities and expectations of interacting with a touchscreen, but also faces many limitations in terms of replicating the experience of the material book. While I imagine that many book publishers and mass digitization project leads decide that because a direct 1:1 translation is impossible that they should not even try, I argue that we learn a great deal of valuable information in the process of remediating nonstandard books to digital formats, especially from what is impossible to replicate.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">To create the overall book, I modified pre-existing code to replicate the page-turning experience. This is now a widely recognizable animation in many e-readers. I uploaded the digital images that I designed in Illustrator for the original book, making some modifications to flatten and replicate the augmented elements on the recto sides of the page spreads (as explained in the previous section). This is much easier to do as the creator of both the physical and digital book, which is why I argue that considering the digitization process from the inception of the book design is so important. The digital book is, of course, limited by my technical capabilities and the technology&rsquo;s capabilities. One limitation of using a swipe touch function to turn the pages is that you cannot directly open the book from the front cover to the back, but must go sequentially back and forth. The animation replicates the stiffness or rigidity of turning a board book page, but not the bulk of the page built up from the foam core. And in order to add the functional elements, I used hyperlinks to go to separate pages. Though the hyperlink is also a recognizable web element, in the future I would like to develop the action to occur as if &ldquo;in the book,&rdquo; rather than separated.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">To create the interactive field goal, I modified pre-existing code to replicate the flick football experience. Because a touchscreen operates in a virtual 2D space rather than a 3D space, many changes were required. I designed the touchscreen experience to look like an aerial view experience. Since there is no way to open up the field goal post, it exists as a flat line. The astroturf texture has been flattened to a solid green. The football player is rendered as a small blue circle rather than the reader&rsquo;s fingers. Rather than a flicking motion, the player must control the player across the screen to collide with and nudge the football into the goal. I argue that while the experience is very different, it still functions as a stand-in for the play event that both material and virtual book are representing or symbolizing: the kicker scoring a field goal at a football game. The virtual game can also keep score in a way that the material book cannot.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">To create the interactive whiteboard, I replicated many touchscreen drawing projects. The dry erase functionalities that are replicated are drawing lines and erasing the board. Though it does not replicate the experience of holding a mini-dry erase marker (unless you have a mini touch stylus), the virtual experience has a few advantages. The real whiteboard must be erased methodically, while one touch of a virtual button can wipe the entire digital board clean. And while the physical book only includes a black dry erase marker, the virtual book can switch to orange and blue as well, demonstrating the possibilities for the virtual to be advantageous.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>To create the interactive mini-book, I replicated the code for the full book and resized it to fit the small pages of the mini-book. I used the same images that I designed and printed, but was not able to replicate the scent that I added to the pages. Recognizing this loss is imperative for speculating what kinds of improvements might be made in the future. When the iPad first came out, there were some novelty experiments into adding smell, including PopSecret&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pop Dongle&rdquo; that emitted the smell of popcorn</span><sup><a href="#ftnt115" id="ftnt_ref115">[115]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;or Oscar Mayer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Wake Up and Smell the Bacon&rdquo; alarm app and iPhone dongle that emitted the smell of bacon.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt116" id="ftnt_ref116">[116]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;I also did not recreate the lamp digitally, but, in the future, I would like to add the functionality of pulling a virtual tab to make the lights virtually turn on.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>I knew I wanted the interactive science lab to work as a touch event, since it would not be as practical to have anything respond to temperature, as the electronics inside a touchscreen device or a computer generate heat generally outside of the control of the user. The element that I thought most important to replicate is that the reader makes a change that causes the colors in the beakers and flasks to change. The color changes and shapes remain the same as in the physical book, going from red to orange to yellow, from yellow to green, from colorless to blue, and from magenta to purple. It would be possible in the future to make an app that is sensitive to temperature or other changes, as demonstrated in Al Gore&rsquo;s </span><span class="c8">Our Choice</span><span>&nbsp;iPad app, where the user can blow into the iPad&rsquo;s microphone to make the windmill spin.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt117" id="ftnt_ref117">[117]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">To create the interactive bell, I modified code from a bell alarm to be a bell swinging to the sound of the bells at the Century Tower. While the sound mechanism in the physical book can only record and playback eight seconds of sound, I could include a much longer recording of the Century Tower bells online. In the future, I would have the option of adding multiple recordings and randomizing them. Currently, the bell moves at a predetermined animation, but it would also be possible to also make the bell manipulable to more closely replicate the bell in the physical book.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">All of these separate interactive elements include a return button that brings the user to the previous window, the original book, so they can continue reading the story. Designing the interactive touchscreen book really helped me more fully understand the limitations and possibilities for code to create a virtual representation of physical interactivity. For this reason, I argue that the original creator(s) should have as much input as possible in adaptations to other media, as the creator(s) can make the design decisions necessary regarding what traits to emphasize, what elements are crucial, and what parts can be cut.</span></p>

    <h2 class="c12" id="h.putddcrssqn6"><span class="c20">Digital and Print Coexisting</span></h2>
    <p class="c6"><span>A common framing of the print and digital book argument is that of a debate, a versus, which one is better. I argue, based on my research, pedagogy, and maker projects, that it should not be an either/or discussion, but a recognition that both have value. One text that forces the user to engage with both print and digital to get the full story is Amaranth Borsuk and Brad Bouse&rsquo;s </span><span class="c8">Between Page and Screen</span><span>. The website for their book details, &ldquo;The story unfolds through a playful and cryptic exchange of letters between P and S as they struggle to define their relationship. Rich with innuendo, anagrams, etymological and sonic affinities between words, </span><span class="c8">Between Page and Screen</span><span>&nbsp;revels in language and the act of reading.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt118" id="ftnt_ref118">[118]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;This work consists of printed visual symbols that trigger augmented poetry when the book is held up to the computer&rsquo;s camera. The book alone cannot be read by humans, only computers, and the virtual poetry cannot be viewed without the book. </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>Admittedly, </span><span class="c8">Between Page and Screen</span><span>&nbsp;is not an adaptation, but rather a purposefully hybrid piece. I mentioned another example of digital and print coexisting earlier: Moonbot Studios&rsquo; </span><span class="c8">The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore</span><span>. It began as an animated short film, was then adapted to an iPad app, and then was adapted to a print book. Their website describes the three adaptations. &ldquo;The story is a poignant, humorous allegory about the curative powers of story. Morris Lessmore is old-fashioned and cutting edge at the same time, utilizing a variety of production techniques including hand-crafted miniatures, computer animation, 2D animation, augmented reality and innovative interactivity.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt119" id="ftnt_ref119">[119]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>This &ldquo;adaptation process&rdquo; is perhaps reverse to the &ldquo;natural order&rdquo; we are familiar with: book to digital or book to film. But the truth is that a good story can be presented in multiple mediums and that one format does not, I argue, dilute interest for the other, but rather enhances it. As Booklist writes, &ldquo;Perhaps most fascinating, the movie, app, and book taken together present an entirely kid-friendly opportunity to talk about the interplay between content and format.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt120" id="ftnt_ref120">[120]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;This is why it is vital that children&rsquo;s books not be left out of digitization practices even if the books are more difficult to digitize. Indeed, I might argue that they should be included precisely </span><span class="c8">because</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;they are more difficult. Touch-and-feel books teach children how to interact with the material world and book digitizations teach children how to interact with the virtual world. Both experiences have value.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>My final example of adaptation is atypical in that the app was actually designed before the book and the same person designed both forms. David A. Carter, a graphic designer turned author/illustrator/paper engineer/app designer, collaborated with Ruckus Media and Unicorn Labs to make an app inspired by his critically acclaimed Color series. The app, </span><span class="c8">Spot the Dot</span><span>, has ten scenes in which the player must spot and touch a specific colored dot, and the app is randomized so that the dots are in different places each time you restart the app. The app also provides teaching tips that emphasize the connection between play and cognitive development by augmenting the main task with side-quests to learn vocabulary, color and shape identification, and counting skills. The most fascinating scenes in terms of tactile interaction are the orange and white dots. To spot the white dot, the player encounters an overwhelming kaleidoscope of colors and shapes but after very careful inspection, will conclude that the white dot is not, in fact, on the screen. Through tactile experimentation (or by using the hints) the player will realize that they are looking at only perhaps 1/6</span><span class="c24">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">of the entire mural and will have to drag the image around to locate the white dot. To spot the orange dot, the player encounters a nearly all black screen with just a small circle of color, but with experimentation learns that they can move around the spotlight with their finger to reveal the scene behind.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>How can this possibly be done as a movable book, one might ask? Either Carter had a future pop-up project in mind or he has a keen understanding of how interactivity might translate across media, because in the movable book adaptation of the app, </span><span class="c8">Spot the Dot</span><span class="c0">, to spot the green dot, you have a similar scene of all black and just a circle of color beneath the black layer, but instead of moving your finger across the screen, you turn the volvelle (spinning disk) to reveal different parts of the scene underneath. Carter also includes pull-tabs and lift-the-flaps to increase interactivity, though once you&#39;ve spotted everything once, you have finished the &quot;game&quot; as it were, though you are still free to &quot;play&quot; beyond the instructions. But what if the movable book came first; how different might the digitization look? What if it was not touch interactions but spatiotemporal displacement that took precedent? </span></p>

    <!-- Chapter 3 -->
    <h2 class="w3-padding-16 w3-text-light-grey" id="abcd">Chapter 3: ABCD: Accessible Books via Critical Digitization</h2>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">In this chapter, I first explore the place of book digitization in digital humanities. I rely on the concept of critical digitization to frame my project as one that focuses on creating digitizations of movable books that support at least some of their mechanical operations. I next introduce the history of movable books to address potential misconceptions about the form and audience. By reviving this niche history in a media archaeology framework, I argue that excluding pop-up books from popular conversation leaves them vulnerable to being easily overlooked in mass digitization projects like Google Books (as are the material properties of many books). I then provide an overview of my research conducted as the toy and movable books intern at the Baldwin Library of Historical Children&rsquo;s Literature, including the experimental making of animated GIFs and 3D models with photogrammetry. I continue by connecting the digitization work in cultural heritage to possibilities for my own project, including public outreach and accessibility. I recognize the limitations of digitization as well as the subjective influences imparted by the digitizer&rsquo;s selections of quality and quantity as well as included metadata. I also distinguish between a digitization as a virtual reference of a material object vs. a digital replica. I then enact a critical making approach by outlining how I design and construct a pop-up guide to campus landmarks and bind the dummy book. I next enumerate the steps involved in creating a new type of book digitization, repurposing sensory input hardware and virtual reality software to create a volumetric capture (a 3D model that can be viewed moving on a timeline). I conclude with a discussion of the fruitful collaborations that can occur between GLAMs and digital humanists.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <h2 class="c12" id="h.ax80igfhx7bm"><span class="c20">What is Critical Digitization?</span></h2>
    <p class="c6"><span>Digitizing books has straddled the line of academic/commercial endeavor in the 20th and 21st centuries. Many trace the field of digital humanities back to the</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;Index Thomisticus</span><span>&nbsp;project in the 1950s, a collaborative effort between International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), a scholarly Jesuit priest, and many uncredited female punch card operators to make the works of St. Thomas Aquinas accessible.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt121" id="ftnt_ref121">[121]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Since the project&rsquo;s inception, the project deliverables have included an annotated, searchable edition of Aquinas&rsquo; work and the index of keywords, first as printed volumes, then as CD-ROMs, and finally as an online searchable text. Project Gutenberg, named after the most cited (yet not first) inventor of the printing press, relied on the Xerox Sigma V computer purchased by the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign&rsquo;s Materials Research Laboratory. Michael Hart&rsquo;s narrative lineage claims of Project Gutenberg (1971) as the &ldquo;first provider of free electronic books,&rdquo; (some of which could be categorized as book digitizations, though most are plain vanilla ASCII textual transcriptions) has been examined for veracity by ebook scholar Simon Rowberry. Hart experimented by typing the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights, but the first full book he transcribed was the Bible, and his aim was to provide as many books out of copyright as he could find.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt122" id="ftnt_ref122">[122]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Unlike these two projects started by academics relying on corporate technological assistance, the Google Print Library Project (2004) was started by a company, Google, approaching partnerships with Harvard, the University of Michigan, the New York Public Library, Oxford, and Stanford, in order to digitize over 15 millions books from the collective&rsquo;s holdings. The following year, Google Print rebranded as Google Books and lead to a hotly contested controversy about copyright, fair use, and public domain.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt123" id="ftnt_ref123">[123]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Google won their court case against the Author&rsquo;s Guild, but lost their zeal for the project, which slowed significantly after 2012. </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">Even though Google Books&rsquo; mass digitization dwindled, the technology became affordable enough for libraries to invest in book scanners, allowing for individuals and teams at universities to digitize books. And though providing access to out-of-print, rare, historical books has been a leading motivation for first-wave digital humanities projects, the complexity of movable and interactive books has rendered their omission a virtual certainty. Earliest book digitization projects aimed at text capture at the expense of materiality, and this mindset led to &ldquo;destructive scanning.&rdquo; In order to save money and time, typical workflows would include a horrifying dismemberment (chopping off the book&rsquo;s spine with a guillotine paper cutter) and placing the loose pages in the automatic document feeder of a scanner. Worse still, many book copies were destroyed after digitization. Fortunately, most digitization projects now employ non-destructive scanning methods, either placing a book face-down on a flatbed scanner, or face-up to be photographed and digitally flattened by software in post-production. Large-scale projects still often depend on ethically questionable outsourced labor to meet demand. Smaller-scale projects can avoid these ethical dilemmas and demand by having a concentrated focus on which books they intend to digitize, rather than &ldquo;as many as possible&rdquo; or &ldquo;all in our collection.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>Digitization on such a massive scale may include unnecessary and unproductive labor. Digital humanities scholar, Mats Dahlstr&ouml;m, coined the term &#39;critical digitization&#39; in the article &quot;As We May Digitize&quot; to refer to more selective digitizations; &quot;critical digitization is qualitative in the sense that it </span><span class="c8">concentrates on what is unique</span><span>&nbsp;and contingent in the documents&hellip;. In &nbsp;consequence, then, critical digitization normally has to </span><span class="c8">develop project-specific practices</span><span>&nbsp;and tools, tailoring them to the qualities of the documents in the particular collection.&quot;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt124" id="ftnt_ref124">[124]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;This particular approach is most intriguing as it dismisses the one-solution-fits-all, and requires experimentation and innovation to generate a procedure that is directly applicable to a subset of artifacts. Considering this principle, focusing digitization on the unique aspects of movable/ interactive books would require targeting the replication of the movability or interactivity, rather than only the images or text on the pages. In </span><span class="c8">Between the Humanities and the Digital</span><span>, Dahlstr&ouml;m notes, &ldquo;Critical digitization is slow and very costly in relation to the number of produced objects. It addresses a small audience. It may require rare skills in textual and bibliographical scholarship, among other things. It often has an image-oriented ideal where the facsimiles are left without accompanying machine-readable transcriptions.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt125" id="ftnt_ref125">[125]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;This slow speed and small audience is expected in humanities projects, though the cost often needs to be subsidized by a grant. The crossover of book history and digital humanities provides the perfect combination of skills for this type of project, and the emphasis on the material/visual, not just the text is the fundamental core difference between book history and literary studies. </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>This methodological framework then allows an individual to embark on a critical digitization project to provide virtual access to material artifacts. These digitizations are complicated by their status as not-original, not-material, and not-perfect reproduction. Walter Benjamin&#39;s foundational essay &ldquo;The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction&rdquo; argues that we pay attention to issues of aura and authenticity in regards to reproduction of artifacts with aesthetic value. Replicas are not equivalent to the original, but rather serve their own purposes and amplify the necessity to preserve the original. In </span><span class="c8">Between Humanities and the Digital</span><span>, Maurizio Forte assesses the relevance of authenticity in a digitization, noting, &quot;[I]t is impossible to define a digital reconstruction as &#39;authentic&#39; but it is surely possible to make the full process of model creation transparent.&quot;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt126" id="ftnt_ref126">[126]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Providing guides to how digitizations were made gives the viewer more context when interpreting the digital artifacts. Keith Smith&#39;s artist statement also provides another aspect for consideration when digitizing a codex: &quot;I am concerned with the book-as-object. I am equally concerned with the book-as-experience. Here, the physical is used as transition &hellip;. The sound, cast light and shadows and their focus and movement, are not part of the physical book. They are physical, but they only come into existence during the act of experiencing the book, that is, turning the page.&quot;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt127" id="ftnt_ref127">[127]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;The concept of book-as-experience also supports the argument for digitizing by more dynamic than static means. When digitizing a pop-up, it is not just the fully open page spread that matters, but the motion created by the mechanics of opening the page. This experience is best digitized via spatial-temporal means, as will be discussed later.</span></p>

    <p class="c6"><span>The inceptive innovations of paper engineering aligns with the widespread popularity of the printing press in the 15th and 16th centuries. The earliest extant examples of movable and interactive books traces back to the 16th century with volvelles (rotatable paper disks) in astronomical texts such as Peter Apian&rsquo;s </span><span class="c8">Astronomicus Caeseareum</span><span>&nbsp;(1540),</span><sup><a href="#ftnt128" id="ftnt_ref128">[128]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;where the reader could align sections of the wheel to perform simple calculations, (though it is estimated volvelles existed as early as the 13th century). Anatomical lift-the-flaps were also an early form of interactive, movable books, including Andreas Vesalius&rsquo; </span><span class="c8">De humani corporis fabrica Epitome</span><span>&nbsp;(1543),</span><sup><a href="#ftnt129" id="ftnt_ref129">[129]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;which included a sheet of drawings meant to be cut, glued, and assembled to form a layered paper human model, with skeletal, cardiovascular, organ, muscular, and cutaneous systems on separate levels. Wealthy subject enthusiasts like Sir Henry Billingsley could also enhance texts like his English translation of Euclid&rsquo;s </span><span class="c8">Elements of Geometrie</span><span>&nbsp;(1570)</span><sup><a href="#ftnt130" id="ftnt_ref130">[130]</a></sup><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span>with pasted-in pop-up polyhedrons instead of the traditional two-dimensional illustrations. Yet despite this academic history, many adults today denigrate pop-ups as merely toy books for children. Certainly there is a wealth of historical movable, interactive books made for children to illustrate play,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt131" id="ftnt_ref131">[131]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;illuminate fantasy,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt132" id="ftnt_ref132">[132]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;and animate nature.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt133" id="ftnt_ref133">[133]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;But this misconceived conflation of medium with genre is often made with mediums that become popular for youth, including comics, animation, and video games, making distinctions of &ldquo;graphic novels,&rdquo; &ldquo;adult animation,&rdquo; and &ldquo;critical, serious games&rdquo; necessary for scholars to garner respect for their subject matter. These binaries of course distract from the fact that texts for children are still made </span><span class="c8">by</span><span>&nbsp;adults who made conscious efforts into the innovation and storytelling of their works and deserve equal critical attention, as the field of children&rsquo;s literature, media, and culture has been arguing </span><span class="c8">ad nauseum</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;for decades. Throughout this section, I will demonstrate how movable books cycled from adult, to child, back to adult audiences and will outline the trend in movable books from entertainment, to promotional, to educational, to commercial, to collectible. In drawing upon this history, I argue that an entire medium should not be infantilized and subsequently dismissed, but rather regarded as an integral part of book history and media studies.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>As previously mentioned, the earliest extant movable books come to us from the 16th century at the advent of the scientific revolution. Movable elements were engineered to enhance the reader&rsquo;s understanding of the natural world. Any attempt to unearth what children were reading in the 16th century would likely return educational and moralistic texts. This is to say that movable books were created before the conception of children&rsquo;s literature arose. The encyclopedic textbook, </span><span class="c8">Orbis Pictus,</span><span>&nbsp;by Comenius is often cited as the first picturebook intended for children and was not published until 1658. The current western understanding of &ldquo;childhood&rdquo; is itself a socioeconomic construct that emerged in the late 18th century with an expanding middle class. John Newbery is often cited as one of the earliest to capitalize on marketing books specifically for children, and his commercial success led others to innovate in children&rsquo;s book publishing. One such innovator was Robert Sayer, who created scenes that </span><span>metamorphosized</span><span>&nbsp;when the reader opened the flaps, very simple early examples of children&rsquo;s movables. He coined these as &ldquo;harlequinades,&rdquo; based off his main character, the Harlequin, from pantomime theater, and the term persisted as others copied his technique. The golden age of movable books is often cited around the end of the 19th century. Thomas and George Dean revolutionized children&rsquo;s books in England by taking advantage of the new invention, lithography, and specifically focusing on publishing novelty and toy books as Dean &amp; Son. Not only did they create peep shows that lifted off the page by ribbon, but they also created pull tab animations, and the dissolving scenes technique, which used a pull tab to move alternating slats of paper, as in </span><span class="c8">Dean&rsquo;s new book of dissolving pictures</span><span>&nbsp;by Dean &amp; Son (1862).</span><sup><a href="#ftnt134" id="ftnt_ref134">[134]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Bookmakers from Germany like Ernest Nister and Raphael Tuck and Sons also enhanced toy and movable books, but most ingenious was paper engineer, Lothar Meggendorfer, who generated complex animations from a single pull tab with a paper pulley system hidden behind the pages, as seen in </span><span class="c8">Always Jolly: A Movable Toybook</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;by Lothar Meggendorfer (1891). In the 1880s, the McLoughlin Brothers company was one of the first to produce pop-up books for American children by emulating (and even pirating) the style and stories of European pop-ups.</span></p>
    <p class="c6 c11"><span>The next renaissance of pop-up books flourished in the United States in the 1930s and 40s and was heavily influenced by contemporary popular culture and animation. For example, Walt Disney Studios collaborated with Blue Ribbon Publishing to release </span><span class="c8">The &quot;Pop-up&quot; Minnie Mouse</span><span>&nbsp;(1933). Blue Ribbon Publishing was the first to use the term &ldquo;pop-up,&rdquo; though their patent used the term, &ldquo;self-erecting illustration.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt135" id="ftnt_ref135">[135]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;At the time, these pop-up books cost $0.75 to $2.00</span><sup><a href="#ftnt136" id="ftnt_ref136">[136]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;and were therefore more expensive than competing picturebooks like dime comics and the Little Big Books ($0.10), but still relatively accessible. In the 1950s and 60s, pop-up books began to reference influences from science, art, and architecture. For example, Vojt&#283;ch Kuba&scaron;ta, a Prague architect and artist, engineered books like </span><span class="c8">Tip &amp; Top and the moon rocket </span><span>(1964),</span><sup><a href="#ftnt137" id="ftnt_ref137">[137]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;which launches a paper rocket when the reader presses down on the base. The McLoughlin Brothers also incorporated scientific education in titles like </span><span class="c8">The Jolly Jump Ups Journey Through Space</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(1952). By the 1980s and 1990s, National Geographic was publishing their own educational pop-up titles about animals and nature. This trend brought movable books full circle to their original educational purposes, though now with a child audience in mind.</span></p>
    <p class="c6 c11"><span>In the early 21st century, many book artists/paper engineers have elevated pop-up books to collectible status, from David Carter&rsquo;s Color series introduction to postmodern artists like Matisse and Mondrian, to Ray Marshall&rsquo;s </span><span class="c8">Paper Blossoms: A Book of Beautiful Bouquets for the Table</span><span>, to Kelli Anderson&rsquo;s </span><span class="c8">This Book is a Planetarium</span><span>&nbsp;including movable paper elements like a pop-up string instrument, a volvelle decoder, and a pop-up planetarium. And the masters, Robert Sabuda and Matthew Reinhart (each with multiple Meggendorfer Prizes for Paper Engineering), have each adapted several children&rsquo;s classics and contemporary favorites into pop-ups. Robert Sabuda has adapted </span><span class="c8">The Wonderful Wizard of Oz </span><span>(2000), </span><span class="c8">The Chronicles of Narnia</span><span>&nbsp;(2007), </span><span class="c8">Peter Pan</span><span>&nbsp;(2008), </span><span class="c8">Beauty and the Beast</span><span>&nbsp;(2010), and </span><span class="c8">The Little Mermaid </span><span>(2013), while Matthew Reinhart&rsquo;s bibliography includes </span><span class="c8">Cinderella</span><span>&nbsp;(2005) and </span><span class="c8">The Jungle Book</span><span>&nbsp;(2006), as well as a collaboration with Maurice Sendak, </span><span class="c8">Mommy?</span><span>&nbsp;(2006), and the two paper engineers even teamed up to adapt Tomie de Paola&rsquo;s </span><span class="c8">Brava, Strega Nona: a heartwarming pop-up book </span><span class="c0">(2008). These classics adapted in pop-up book form captivate adult and child audiences alike, and many are surprisingly affordable, around $39.99.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>My own interest in movable books stems from one of my earliest memories of reading experiences, David Pelham&rsquo;s </span><span class="c8">Sam&rsquo;s Sandwich</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(1990), which incorporated lift the flaps to finish the poems of each page spread. The anticipation from the ellipsis, the understanding of the rhyming schema, and the knowledge of the content were required to fully read the book. For example, the text on the verso page of a spread reads, </span></p>
    <p class="c6 c17"><span class="c0">Samantha yelled, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen</span></p>
    <p class="c6 c17"><span class="c0">lettuce leaves so crisp and green.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c6 c17"><span class="c0">But as a tasty little filler,</span></p>
    <p class="c6 c17"><span class="c0">Sam popped in a &hellip; </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">And as the reader unfold flaps of cardstock illustrated as lettuce on the facing recto page, a &ldquo;caterpillar&rdquo; is revealed to be amongst the greens. The reader squeals with abject horror and schadenfreude delight in anticipation that Samantha will eventually eat this sandwich with all of these bugs hidden inside. Movable books continue to advance with new technology and experimentation in paper engineering.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>With the advancement in paper engineering technologies comes the shift to more adult-focused content. Just as </span><span class="c8">Sam&rsquo;s Sandwich</span><span>&nbsp;incorporates dramatic irony to place the reader as voyeur with intimate knowledge that is hidden to the character, Matthew Reinhart&rsquo;s </span><span class="c8">Pop-Up Book of Phobias</span><span>&nbsp;(1999) promises the reader &ldquo;all your worst nightmares made frighteningly, hilariously real.&rdquo; Each page spread uses unique techniques of pop-ups to involve the reader. For example, the first page spread about dentophobia, fear of the dentist, uses the mechanics of opening the page to have a menacing dentist angling a sharp instrument right at the viewer. On the page spread about acrophobia, a fear of heights, a tall corner of the building pops up and the illustrations use forced perspective to make it look like looking down to the street from a skyscraper.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt138" id="ftnt_ref138">[138]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;This book of course is made for adults who enjoy the thrill of scary confrontation, not children. This was likely the beginning in Reinhart&rsquo;s shift to creating adult pop-up books, such as his pop-up guides to fictional worlds with massive adult fanbases, including </span><span class="c8">Star Wars: A Pop-Up Guide to the Galaxy</span><span>&nbsp;(2011), </span><span class="c8">Game of Thrones: A Pop-Up Guide to Westeros</span><span>&nbsp;(2014), and </span><span class="c8">Harry Potter: A Pop-Up Guide to Hogwarts</span><span>&nbsp;(2018). The last two are particularly innovative as the magnetic binding can be unfastened to unfold the spreads into one giant pop-up map. In </span><span class="c8">Harry Potter: A Pop-Up Guide to Hogwarts</span><span class="c0">, the pop-ups represent key locations from the wizarding campus, including the Hogwarts castle, the Quidditch pitch, the Forbidden Forest, and the Shrieking Shack. For Wizarding World fans, these locations are iconic and can instantly conjure memories associated with each landmark. </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">Movable books are, admittedly, still a niche market, though, as demonstrated, not limited to children. It is to the cultural detriment that many US book publishers are not interested in overseeing assembly overseas, or require movable books to already have built-in audiences, like adaptations of classics and pop-ups of popular culture. Movable books in fact do a great deal in service of proving why paper books are still necessary and should be a boon to book publishers. However, one consequence of movable books&rsquo; current niche status is that they are often left out of popular conversation, and thus left out of mass digitization efforts like Google Books. It is therefore incumbent upon digital humanists to examine critically what is left out of corporate efforts of digitization and remedy these omissions to the best of our abilities.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c12" id="h.v3n7hociczru"><span class="c20">Efforts as Toy and Movable Books Intern at the Baldwin Library of Historical Children&rsquo;s Literature</span></h2>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">In collaboration with Suzan Alteri, curator of the Baldwin Library of Historical Children&rsquo;s Literature (hereafter, the Baldwin), I proposed and was awarded a library graduate internship grant from the University of Florida in order to spend the fall 2017 semester identifying and categorizing movable book artifacts in the collection, evaluating their condition (fragility and movability), selecting books for digitization, and generating a list for acquisitions based on gaps in the holding. This collaborative project was mutually beneficial in enhancing the digital and physical holdings of the library, but also jump-starting my own project on digitizing movable books. The main obstacle for digitizing books from my private collection was copyright concerns, but the Baldwin special collection spans history and mediums and had quite a few examples to digitize pre-1923, including the popular work of Dean &amp; Son, Ernest Nister, and Lothar Meggendorfer. </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>The most prestigious award offered by The Movable Book Society is the Meggendorfer Prize for Best Paper Engineering, named after Lothar Meggendorfer, a German paper engineer extraordinaire whose work spans from the late 19th to the early 20th century. The Baldwin holdings include four original Meggendorfer books, as well as five reproductions. Each work is truly a state-of-the-art feat of paper engineering, made up of complex networks of pull-tabs, strategic slots, and hand-spun metal coils. Meggendorfer can make an elephant trunk lift off the page to reveal its tongue</span><sup><a href="#ftnt139" id="ftnt_ref139">[139]</a></sup><span>, butterflies flap their wings</span><sup><a href="#ftnt140" id="ftnt_ref140">[140]</a></sup><span>, and even two pairs of chickens simultaneously alternate between up and down their food trough with the single pull of tab</span><sup><a href="#ftnt141" id="ftnt_ref141">[141]</a></sup><span class="c0">. I found quite a few artifacts categorized through the subject heading &ldquo;Toy and movable books -- Specimens&rdquo; in the online library catalog. Special collections librarians, Steve Hersh and Michele Wilbanks pulled all 83 pre-1923 specimens that I had identified and I spent days carefully reading each book in order to categorize the type of movables (harlequinade, lift-the-flap, dissolving scenes, volvelles, pop-ups) and assess the condition (needs repair, all moving parts working) in order to determine which books would be best to digitize.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>A comparable project that served as a source for inspiration was &quot;Learning as Play: An Animated, Interactive Archive of 17th- to 19th- Century Narrative Media for and by Children.&quot;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt142" id="ftnt_ref142">[142]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Librarians and humanist scholars at Penn State started this project, developing the Virtual Movable Book App, a web application to facilitate playing with a 19th century transformation book using the Unity game engine. Users can fold, unfold, zoom, and read the book in a virtual space.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt143" id="ftnt_ref143">[143]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;This lift-the-flap app captures the interactive spirit of the original 1814 picturebook and is an excellent first step in creating digital representations of movable books. The project was partially funded by an NEH Digital Humanities Start-Up Grant and there are 44 partners and contributors listed on their site, making it a wonderful example of what can be accomplished through digital humanities collaboration.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>In </span><span class="c8">Understanding Digital Humanities</span><span>, N. Katherine Hayles argues; &quot;Remarkable works endure in part because they complicate, modify, extend, and subvert conventions, rising above the mundane works that surrounded them in their original contexts&quot; (46)</span><sup><a href="#ftnt144" id="ftnt_ref144">[144]</a></sup><span class="c0">. With this in mind, I attempted to select books that represented a range of movable types and had the most dramatic interactions to digitize. This included disks that spun behind cutouts to reveal a second scene, overlapping slats that revealed a second scene, and paper pull tabs that rigged movement. The animations of the volvelles, dissolving scenes, and pull-tab movable books moved the paper elements mostly on a flat plane so I determined that a time-based medium was best suited for this form. The impetus for creating animated GIFs for these movable types is that they are an easier format to share than videos because they do not require specific codecs or players and are typically a smaller file size, making them more mobile-friendly and accessible. Still cameras are also commonly less expensive than video cameras, making an animated GIF cheaper to produce, meaning more people can make them themselves. </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>To create these looping animations, I took a series of photographs using a camera stand, camera, and a remote, and captured multiple photographs while making minute manipulations to the book. I then imported these photographs as overlapping layers in the image editing software Adobe Photoshop on my computer using the included &ldquo;Load Files Into Stack&rdquo; script. Next I selected Photoshop&rsquo;s automatic action option to &ldquo;Make Frames From Layers&rdquo;, which auto-generated an animation that could be tested in the timeline, where adjustments to time per slide could be made. Finally, I exported the looping sequence as a graphics interchange format (.gif).</span><sup><a href="#ftnt145" id="ftnt_ref145">[145]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;This trial and error experimentation taught me many valuable lessons in digitizing, including a reminder to white balance the camera settings and provide a ruler and color chart in the future, to be as meticulous and standardized as humanly possible with minute movements, and to ask for collaborative assistance instead of manipulating the movables and capturing the photographs alone. The movements required reader </span><span class="c8">manual</span><span>&nbsp;interactivity, as evidenced by the imperatives &ldquo;</span><span class="c8">pull</span><span>&nbsp;the tab&rdquo; and &ldquo;</span><span class="c8">lift</span><span>&nbsp;the flap&rdquo; or, in the case of the volvelles, &ldquo;</span><span class="c8">spin</span><span>&nbsp;the wheel.&rdquo; However, paper engineering, specifically with pop-ups, has advanced so that the paper moves </span><span class="c8">automatically</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;at the opening the page spread due to the valleys and folds. </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>Contemporary pop-up books exhibit three-dimensional architectural characteristics, and some have impressive twisting motions as the pages unfold. One might speculate that the lack of 3D examples in the Baldwin pre-1923 are due to historical, material-technological constraints. For example, it was not until the early 20th century that innovations in the die-cutter process streamlined the mass production of pop-ups. Furthermore, polyvinyl acetate (PVA glue) was not invented until 1912 in Germany, which allowed for paper adhesion without ripples. One might also hypothesize that cover weight paper, also known as cardstock, became less expensive and more durable with coatings in the 20th century, making sturdier pop-ups possible. How might we then digitize in 3D or even 4D? The Autodesk desktop application Memento uses photogrammetry algorithms to stitch together mesh models and textures based on multiple photographs. As an exercise, I took 130 photographs of Robert Sabuda&rsquo;s </span><span class="c8">Alice&rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(2003) with a digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) camera using a cake turntable and imported the photos to Memento. The resulting 3D model had some holes and errors, likely due to a blurry or incomplete photo set, but I hosted it on Sketchfab, just as many other cultural heritage institutions are now hosting their own 3D models generated from their own artifact collections.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c12" id="h.2nln91nsjzzf"><span class="c20">How GLAMs are Digitizing Their Artifacts</span></h2>
    <p class="c6"><span>In recent years, galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (collectively known as GLAMs) have been working on public outreach and accessibility through posting photographs, videos, and even animated GIFs of artifacts from their collection on social media platforms like Tumblr, Instagram, and Twitter. For example, Harvard&rsquo;s Houghton Library Tumblr</span><sup><a href="#ftnt146" id="ftnt_ref146">[146]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;posts images of books, manuscripts, prints, illustrations, historical photographs, while the University of Iowa&rsquo;s Special Collections Tumblr</span><sup><a href="#ftnt147" id="ftnt_ref147">[147]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;showcases artists&rsquo; books (#ArtsyFartsyFriday) and miniature books (#MiniatureMonday) using days-of-the-week-themed hashtags to quickly signal their content to interested viewers. A select few institutions also have the financial means to 3D scan the artifacts in their collection and share their models online. </span><span class="c11">The </span><span class="c11"><a class="c9" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://3d.si.edu/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1736290171119800&amp;usg=AOvVaw1A5WjAOQBiaF6YeAaSK292">Smithsonian Institute</a></span><span class="c11">&nbsp;uses its own proprietary 3D model repository powered by Autodesk to share 109 models.</span><sup class="c11"><a href="#ftnt148" id="ftnt_ref148">[148]</a></sup><span class="c11">&nbsp;</span><span>The Metropolitan Museum of Art archives 75 models on the US-based website, Thingiverse by Makerbot, allowing anyone with a computer and internet access to download models of artifacts from their virtual collection.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt149" id="ftnt_ref149">[149]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;The most impressive collection, however, is the British Museum, which hosts 255 models on the France-based website, Sketchfab.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt150" id="ftnt_ref150">[150]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Some of these models include cuneiform tablets, a wooden stela, and the Rosetta Stone, precursors to the book medium. The cultural heritage lead at Sketchfab, Thomas Flynn, even organized a collection titled &ldquo;World Book Day&rdquo; of 3D scans from multiple users that includes tablets, scrolls, comics, coptic prayer books, an embroidered binding, and even one pop-up book.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt151" id="ftnt_ref151">[151]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Both Thingiverse and Sketchfab are excellent websites working at the cutting edge of 3D technology, and both platforms make it easy to adapt 3D models for virtual reality hardware like Google Cardboard. &nbsp;However, Thingiverse seems more commercially oriented while Sketchfab is partnered with cultural heritage institutions and scholarly platforms like Taylor &amp; Francis Journals. These partnerships are mutually beneficial in acquiring followers to the social media platform and drawing attention to the artifacts of the GLAMs outside of their immediate geographical location.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>Platforms like Sketchfab provide an avenue for the public to interact with a GLAM&rsquo;s collection online in a manner similar to interacting with other forms of social media. Whitney Trettien wisely asserts, &ldquo;&quot;Digital collections do not obviate these lessons simply by &#39;opening up&#39; library treasures to the &#39;public&#39; &hellip; but extend their significance into a new and very different institutional arena.&quot;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt152" id="ftnt_ref152">[152]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;By providing interactive 3D models of books, the change in context draws attention to the dimensionality of textual artifacts. In </span><span class="c8">Paper Knowledge</span><span>, Lisa Gitelman draws from the history of digital humanities with Robert Busa&#39;s reproduction of St. Thomas Aquinas&#39; work as well as Walter Benjamin&#39;s &quot;Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction&quot; to make the argument that &quot;reproducing means access.&quot;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt153" id="ftnt_ref153">[153]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Especially in terms of rare books and special collections, accessibility to the artifacts is often limited to the location and hours of the library, yet it may be the only extant copy. Museums currently have the lead on libraries in terms of 3D digitization, but perhaps as the tenets of material book history becomes more widespread, the understanding of a book as not just a textual, but a material artifact will be an automatic assumption and will be digitized accordingly.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>In most cases, whoever is in charge determines the quantity and quality of digitization. Mats Dahlstr&ouml;m mentions that the metadata is a particular skill that trained GLAM professionals use to enhance their digitizations that hobbyist users might not include. &quot;[C]ritical digitization enriches its objects with intellectual added value and applies some kind of quality seal with regard to selection, textual quality, resolution, proofreading, comments, and bibliographical information. On the other hand, not all scholars may be interested in that particular metainformation and added value but may be in need of quite different aspects than those that happened to catch the interest of the digitizing institution.&quot;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt154" id="ftnt_ref154">[154]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;For example, the University of Melbourne&rsquo;s Digitisation Centre&rsquo;s 3D model of a 1512 Latin book provides the book title, extensive notes, and a link to a blog post with even more information about the binding material, provenance, historic period, and a bibliography for further reading, perhaps expecting that their users will need all of this information online.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt155" id="ftnt_ref155">[155]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;On the other hand, Indiana University Bloomington&rsquo;s 3D model of a book of common prayer only provided a short description as well as the call number, anticipating that users would see the 3D model and then want to visit the artifact in person.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt156" id="ftnt_ref156">[156]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;By contrast, the Association for Documentation and Diffusion 4D&rsquo;s 3D model of a 1605 copy of </span><span class="c8">Don Quixote de la Mancha</span><span>&nbsp;provides metadata on the text via annotations directly on the model, including engravings illustrating the text by Gustave Dor&eacute;, a 1966 USSR Don Quixote homage stamp, and hyperlinks to the original book, multiple translations, multiple Wikipedia entries, and the live-action movie, cartoon, and radio adaptations</span><sup><a href="#ftnt157" id="ftnt_ref157">[157]</a></sup><span class="c0">. Each of these examples clearly had a different audience in mind, providing metadata on the artifact serving as replica, the artifact serving as reference, and the artifact serving as an icon for the text. The Baldwin Library of Historical Children&rsquo;s Literature&rsquo;s Digital Collection would best be served as a digital reference to a physical material in the collection, whereas an object that is too fragile to be handled by the public might be better served with more information as a replica. I kept this in mind when I planned how I might create a guide for making digitizations to share on Sketchfab of pop-up books, but in order to do that, I needed to create my own movable artifact to avoid infringing copyright.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c12" id="h.8nu4dzehtj17"><span class="c20">Creating a Pop-Up Guide to the University of Florida</span></h2>
    <p class="c6"><span>There is no one official guide on how to make a pop-up, and many intricacies and details are proprietary knowledge and trade secrets. In this section, I describe my own path and practical framework to create my own pop-up book that I invented. In order to accomplish this, I needed to experiment and build prototypes. This learning by making process is a core tenet of my own makeademic philosophy, focusing on a tinker-centric process to generate knowledge. For research, I collected reference images, reverse engineered pop-ups, and practiced the relevant exercises in David A. Carter and James Diaz&rsquo;s </span><span class="c8">The Elements of Pop-Up</span><span>. In the movable book world, the first working prototype of a pop-up book is known as a white dummy. This version emphasizes the functionality of the mechanics without any colors to distract or obscure any errors in the construction. All of the spreads and elements are made with white coverstock and bound together to test how the book operates when the pages are connected. In order to construct my dummy book, I reminded myself that creativity often thrives with constraint, so I chose to limit the form to 6 inches x 6 inches (a constraint mostly chosen by the standardized 12 inches x 12 inches cardstock stacks that could be folded in half to create a spread). I also chose to source the content with inspiration broadly conceived from my surroundings at the University of Florida. In this pop-up guide to the University of Florida, it made sense to make pop-ups of campus landmarks, most notably the oldest building on campus, Thomas Hall (shaped like the letters UF); Century Tower, a carillon bell tower dedicated to UF students who died in service during the World Wars; the Ben Hill Griffin Stadium/ Steve Spurrier Florida Field, the site for many Gators football victories; the Bat House, the world&rsquo;s largest occupied bat house; the Baughman Center, a meditative center overlooking Lake Alice; and the Florida Museum of Natural History&rsquo;s Butterfly Rainforest, the world&rsquo;s largest Lepidoptera research facility. This constraint allowed me to focus on the architectural aspects of paper engineering aimed at an adult audience, much like Matthew Reinhart&rsquo;s </span><span class="c8">Pop-Up Guide to Hogwarts</span><span class="c0">, about a topic (University of Florida) with a built-in fan base (The Gator Nation). The construction of each pop-up spread required experimentation and creativity and several complementary technologies.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>There is no single piece of pop-up maker software/hardware that could make what I needed, so I had to combine an amalgam of technology based on my own expertise with a BFA in Digital Media (Art and Technology) and my hobby experience in crafting. I used the design software Adobe Illustrator to create vector files, which are scalable designs and are necessary to make cuts along outlines. I then used the </span><span class="c8">Silhouette Studio</span><span>&nbsp;software to prepare my vector files to be cut by the </span><span class="c8">Silhouette Cameo</span><span>. The </span><span class="c8">Silhouette Cameo</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is a computer-numerical-controlled cutting machine that moves a blade along one axis with a motor and chain and moves the cutting material with motors along the perpendicular axis. I used a machine to cut rather than an exacto blade because it could get more precise details than I could by hand.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>I also used a combination of the online 3D modeling software </span><span class="c8">Autodesk Tinkercad</span><span>&nbsp;to create 3D models and the desktop software </span><span class="c8">Autodesk Slicer Fusion 360</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to turn 3D models into sliceform (3D objects made with intersecting 2D materials) files. The automation of creating sliceform designs with software ensured that the width of the cardstock would be accounted for and that the final forms would fold properly when opening and closing the book. I also used 78 lb cardstock and &nbsp;&frac14;&rdquo; 3M 415 double-sided tape for construction materials.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>Since the Century Tower is symmetrical along all four sides, I decided to represent it visually as a modified 180&deg; Angle Fold Open Box. &ldquo;In this design, the pop-up is attached to the base page at an angle, C, that is 45&deg; to the gutter. The vertical folds of the box are at 90&deg; to the folds that attach to the base page.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt158" id="ftnt_ref158">[158]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;I designed the cut out shapes based on multiple photographs of the tower and repeated the shape consecutively four times in </span><span class="c8">Illustrator</span><span>, and then added tabs to attach the sides to each other and the base to the page. I then exported the paths as a Drawing eXchange Format (.dxf), and opened that file in </span><span class="c8">Silhouette Studio</span><span>. I then selected to use a cutting mat in the Design tab, selected Material &ldquo;Coverstock, Heavy (105lb-122lb)&rdquo;, Action &ldquo;Cut,&rdquo; and Tool &ldquo;Autoblade&rdquo; and sent the design to the </span><span class="c8">Silhouette Cameo</span><span class="c0">, a hobbyist computer numerical control cutter that can cut vector designs out of paper, vinyl, cardstock, and more. I then meticulously removed the design from the mat, scored and folded along the fold lines, and adhered the form onto the page spread.</span></p>

    <p class="c6"><span>The next pop-up I designed was the Baughman Center, which I designed as a modified 180&deg; Parallel Open Box. &ldquo;In this pop-up, the page positions are parallel to the gutter&hellip; The two panels that cross the gutter have center folds so that they pop-up will collapse.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt159" id="ftnt_ref159">[159]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;I again designed the vector shapes based on multiple photographs of the Baughman Center, but chose to simplify to only include the walls, since the ceiling and roof would have added too many intricacies and complexities. I again added tabs to attach the base to the page. I followed the same steps in </span><span class="c8">Illustrator</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c8">Silhouette Cameo</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to create this form.</span></p>

    <p class="c6"><span>The next pop-up I designed was the Stadium, which I designed as two modified concentric 180&deg; Boats. &ldquo;In this pop-up, the page positions are parallel to the gutter&hellip; When you look straight down on this pop-up, you will see that the open space is somewhat elliptical.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt160" id="ftnt_ref160">[160]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;I then sourced inspiration from the 3D Warehouse Staff&rsquo;s &ldquo;Model of the Ben Hill Griffin Stadium.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt161" id="ftnt_ref161">[161]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;I simplified to key design elements that would still indicate the stadium, including the exits and the sign that reads &ldquo;Florida Field.&rdquo; I again designed in </span><span class="c8">Illustrator</span><span>, cut with the </span><span class="c8">Silhouette Cameo</span><span class="c0">, and hand assembled.</span></p>

    <p class="c6"><span>I was inspired by Yoojin Kim&rsquo;s card &ldquo;F&rdquo; in the Movable Book Society&rsquo;s card collection </span><span class="c8">A to Z: Marvels in Paper Engineering</span><sup class="c8"><a href="#ftnt162" id="ftnt_ref162">[162]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;and realized it would make a good model for the shape of Thomas/Sledd/Fletcher Halls. This form is a modified 180&deg; Tube Post Armature</span><sup><a href="#ftnt163" id="ftnt_ref163">[163]</a></sup><span>. I prototyped and designed the tubes based on a screenshot of the proportions from the online UF campus map</span><sup><a href="#ftnt164" id="ftnt_ref164">[164]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;and again added tabs to connect each piece. I then exported from </span><span class="c8">Illustrator</span><span>&nbsp;to </span><span class="c8">Silhouette Cameo </span><span class="c0">and hand-assembled the five tubes needed to create the structure to look like the letters UF attached.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>In order to demonstrate a different type of pop-up, I designed the UF Bat House as a sliceform, most similar to the 180&deg; Angle Fold Box with Crossing Planes.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt165" id="ftnt_ref165">[165]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;I first made the bat house 3D model</span><sup><a href="#ftnt166" id="ftnt_ref166">[166]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;in </span><span class="c8">Autodesk Tinkercad</span><span>&nbsp;by using 4 &ldquo;roofs&rdquo; intersecting on top of 4 &ldquo;boxes&rdquo; serving as posts. I then exported that 3D model as a stereolithographic file (.stl), and imported it to the free Autodesk software, </span><span class="c8">Slicer Fusion 360</span><span>, which was based on an earlier free software, </span><span class="c8">Autodesk 123D Make</span><span>. I then changed the following settings: change-up axis of the mesh to: Z, Edit/Customize in Manufacturing Settings to 8.5x11x0.04 inches, select Interlocking Slices, rotate axes so that the slices are perpendicular to each other and to the base, and then exported as an Encapsulated PostScript (.eps) file. I opened this file in </span><span class="c8">Illustrator</span><span>&nbsp;and converted it to .dxf to be cut with the </span><span class="c8">Silhouette Cameo</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and hand-assembled.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 832.00px;"> <img src="img/w3images/image4.jpg" alt="photo of white cardstock cutout pop up of bat house in front of bat houses" class="w3-image"> </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>Lastly, to represent the Butterfly Rainforest, I constructed an asymmetrical structure hybrid of the 180&deg; Tube Post Armature</span><sup><a href="#ftnt167" id="ftnt_ref167">[167]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;and the 180&deg; Uneven Tent</span><sup><a href="#ftnt168" id="ftnt_ref168">[168]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;and used the Silhouette to cut out the shape of the metal beams that form the skeleton of the structure. To create the paper butterflies, I selected three photographs of species found in the Butterfly Rainforest: the blue emperor </span><span class="c8">Morpho peleides</span><span>,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt169" id="ftnt_ref169">[169]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;the orange viceroy </span><span class="c8">Limenitis archippus</span><span>,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt170" id="ftnt_ref170">[170]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;and the blue forest queen </span><span class="c8">Euxanthe wakefieldi</span><span>.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt171" id="ftnt_ref171">[171]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;I used </span><span class="c8">Adobe Photoshop</span><span>&nbsp;to adjust the contrast, and then imported these in Adobe Illustrator to use Image Trace to create vectors. I also cut these out with the </span><span class="c8">Silhouette Cameo</span><span class="c0">. The trickiest part was determining how to suspend the paper butterflies within the structure, since the distance from the page to the top of the structure changed depending on if the book was opened or closed. In the end, I punched miniature holes in the butterflies to thread clear jewelry cord through the top of the structure and the bottom of the page. I knotted the cords at both ends when the book was fully open, and glued the bottom knot to the back of the page, allowing the top knot to remain free.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 892.00px;"> <img src="img/w3images/image23.jpg" alt="photo of white cardstock cutout pop up of butterflies in front of the butterfly cage" class="w3-image"> </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>Each pop-up challenged me in unique ways, as I had to determine how abstract or realistic the representation would be. The pop-ups are not currently to scale, as the stadium should be the largest structure, but is one of the smallest, due to the way the wrap had to fold shut. The making process required iterative thinking, as I would create paper prototypes and continue to adjust and tweak before getting the final construction to work. I invoke Garnet Hertz&rsquo; reinterpretation of the term critical making, &ldquo;in encouraging the builders of technology&hellip; to step back and reevaluate the assumptions and values being embedded into their technological designs.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt172" id="ftnt_ref172">[172]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;While I relied heavily on technology to make the book, the end product appears to be an analog structure, devoid of technology. This misperception is because the technologies of tape and coverstock are so ubiquitous as to be rendered invisible. My larger argument rests in the idea that the materiality and interactivity of books are important, and so I agree with Hertz&rsquo; assertion that &ldquo;prototypes materially articulate particular stances and ideas&hellip; and can work to expose the hidden assumptions within the designed objects around us and be embedded in technological systems to a wide audience.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt173" id="ftnt_ref173">[173]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;My project entails me not only creating the digitizations, but also creating the books to make the case for moving paper engineering from fringe to mainstream in book history. I particularly designed my pop-up structures to be sculptural, three-dimensional, viewable from all sides, as this innovation in paper engineering occurred too recently to have any public domain representations. I also selected this form because I am particularly intrigued by the mechanics of the opening and folding of the page to &ldquo;erect the structure,&rdquo; but then being able to fold down something so tall into something so flat. This is the magic of pop-ups that I think is so essential to capture digitally.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>Once all of the page spreads were constructed, I assembled the </span><span class="c8">Pop-Up Guide to UF</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;book dummy thanks to the guidance of 2016 Meggendorfer Prize winner, Shawn Sheehy, and book artist, Ellen Knudson. I cut out wedges from the 78 lb white coverstock I used to construct the pages to connect as hinges along the edges. Once I had the bookblock together, I cut out 6&rdquo; x 6&rdquo; squares of white 6 ply Pacon Railroad Board for the front and back covers and 6&rdquo; x 1&rdquo; for the spine piece, 6&rdquo; x 3&rdquo; of Tyvek, a soft synthetic material, to cover the spine, and used &frac14;&rdquo; 3M 415 tape to connect everything. I miscalculated and probably should have gone with a thinner spine, but the prototype functions well as a model to be digitized. Once the book was constructed, I needed to take the book to the UF Trace Studio to create 4D digitizations.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c12" id="h.fu5f0ya4pwpk"><span class="c20">Guide for Making Volumetric Captures with the Microsoft Kinect and Sharing on Sketchfab</span></h2>
    <p class="c6"><span>As stated earlier, a popular method for sharing GLAM artifacts is via 3D models made from photogrammetry or 3D scanning. But what if the object is not static/stationary? How might it be represented in four dimensions, space and time? Recent innovations in technology include 360&deg; videos (e.g. Google Arts and Culture</span><sup><a href="#ftnt174" id="ftnt_ref174">[174]</a></sup><span>), where multiple wide-angle lens cameras capture the world around them, which can be viewed on a typical desktop screen as a video that users can drag, or as a virtual reality environment. These are excellent environments, but center the user to see the entire world, rather than center an artifact to be seen from every angle. The answer to that is volumetric captures as demonstrated by TimeSlice&rsquo;s 4D model on Sketchfab captured with an array of 53 Hero3+ Black Edition cameras</span><sup><a href="#ftnt175" id="ftnt_ref175">[175]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;or 8i&rsquo;s Custom Holograms using Capture Stages</span><sup><a href="#ftnt176" id="ftnt_ref176">[176]</a></sup><span>. However, these methods are prohibitively expensive. Oliver Kreylos also developed what he termed a 3D video capture with three Kinects but the process was complicated and specifically designed for the Oculus Rift.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt177" id="ftnt_ref177">[177]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Dale Utt of True Edge Archive even experimented to generate his own unique workflow for digitizing a book opening: &ldquo;model was assembled in RealityCapture, cleaned in MeshLab, with animation and texture work done in Blender and Photoshop/Illustrator.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt178" id="ftnt_ref178">[178]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;The only company that offered an affordable option for volumetric captures was Mimesys VR, which released a beta software development kit (SDK) using the Microsoft Kinect to create 4D models that could be directly uploaded to Sketchfab. With a single Microsoft Kinect, you cannot get a 360&deg; virtual model, but it does have an RGB (red, green, blue) camera and a depth sensor. As a trial software, it allowed for very quick captures (approximately 60 frames), but directly uploaded to Sketchfab. </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">In order to record a capture, the setup required a Microsoft Kinect with a USB cable to connect to a PC computer, the MimesysVR software, and a relatively homogenous background. In the Trace Innovation Initiative Studio, I set up the book on a black cloth and placed the Kinect on a chair approximately 2 and a half feet away. Within the Mimesys Recorder software, I adjusted the controls to not filter humans, to define the capture box (left, right, top, bottom, far), set texture to high, mesh to high, and frame rate to full. I then pressed record in the software, walked over to the setup to turn the page, and then walked back to press the stop button. In the next step I was able to crop just the frames I wanted to export. This created a proprietary file, (.q3d), which I could then upload to my Sketchfab account.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>For each pop-up, since the maximum recording length was 60 frames, I tested and selected various angles depending on the pop-up type. For the first pop-up, the Thomas Hall UF structure, when I tested from a perpendicular view, the meaning of the shapes was obscured. I decided to open the page parallel to the camera from right to left.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt179" id="ftnt_ref179">[179]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;However, I then switched the book to be perpendicular when opening the Century Tower from right to left.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt180" id="ftnt_ref180">[180]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;I then rotated the book 90&deg; and opened from back to front so that the Stadium would show the Florida Field sign in the back.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt181" id="ftnt_ref181">[181]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;I next opened the page from back to front in the same orientation to showcase the side of the Baughman Center.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt182" id="ftnt_ref182">[182]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;I then rotated the book 180&deg; so I could open the Bat House from front to back.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt183" id="ftnt_ref183">[183]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Finally, for the last pop-up book, I rotated the book 90&deg; so I could open the Butterfly Rainforest from right to left.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt184" id="ftnt_ref184">[184]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;These volumetric captures were meant to give a glimpse at the opening mechanisms, but I also created volumetric captures rotating the structure so that they could be seen from at least two angles.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt185" id="ftnt_ref185">[185]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">This process was experimental in nature, designed to create proofs of concept, not polished finalized pieces. Based on the resolution and file size, the captures are &ldquo;fuzzy,&rdquo; especially the closer the book gets to the camera, showcasing the limitations of repurposing Kinect technology. Sketchfab is well-suited for publicly sharing 3D models and has several built-in capabilities. For example, every model uploaded to Sketchfab can be viewed on desktop, in mobile AR, or Google Cardboard VR, though scrubbing through the timeline is still most easily operated with a mouse or trackpad. This prototype argues that books cannot be wholly experienced in photographs, or videos, or even 3D models, that there is still technology to be developed that can get us closer to a virtual experience, especially if we do not have access to the original, likely in the case of rare or one-of-a-kind books. </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">Within the confines of an individual student working on a limited budget, this is what I was able to accomplish. In future collaborative iterations, I have many more goals and plans for improvement. Future improvements in the setup would include better lighting, using color illustrations instead of plain white to avoid artifacting, using multiple cameras to get a more comprehensive view of the structure, improving the resolution, and devising some mechanism to flip the pages so my hands do not show.</span></p>

    <h2 class="c12" id="h.n9en6y5en96"><span class="c20">Digital Humanists Collaborating with GLAMs for Access</span></h2>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">One expected takeaway of this project is to dispel the notion that digital humanists want to replace the critical work of librarians, archivists, and museum curators of preserving our cultural heritage. I argue that most digitization projects come out of a desire to provide greater worldwide access to scholars and enthusiasts who have limited mobility or inadequate financial means to travel across the world, especially when a collection is otherwise scattered geographically. In order to accomplish these goals, digital humanists must collaborate with GLAM experts throughout project development, sharing ideas for metadata, negotiating optimal overlapping conditions for the preservation and fullest virtual representation of the artifact, and arranging for long term project maintenance.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>My project would not have been possible without first collaborating with Baldwin Library curator Suzan Alteri to experiment with videos, animated GIFs, and photogrammetry with previously existing movable books. I consulted with her on how much photographic manipulation was acceptable based on the quality of my camera, what lighting conditions and manual manipulations were acceptable for historic materials, and her considerations in terms of hosting the results in the UF digital collection for long-term access and maintenance. It was only through this experimentation that I recognized that making my own book would give me insight into digitization and making my own digitization would give me insight into making the book. For example, after creating a sample 3D model of Robert Sabuda&rsquo;s intricately die-cut, holographic </span><span class="c8">Alice&rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland</span><span class="c0">, I learned to avoid metallic or reflective surfaces and leave fewer gaps that might confuse an algorithm. Likewise, my experimentation with the volumetric captures of books from the Baldwin taught me to position the Kinect camera at an adequate distance from the subject.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>When I presented my research at the Movable Book Society conference in 2018, it was met with great enthusiasm and ideas for improvement. Larry Seidman pointed me to his work in creating animated GIFs of movables from his personal collection. Other colleagues suggested that more opportunities for virtual manipulation like in Penn State&rsquo;s project were intriguing. One colleague even suggested that seeing my hands was not a detriment but an asset; &ldquo;I, for one, especially appreciate the inclusion of hands, which show scale, ease of mechanism, and timing.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt186" id="ftnt_ref186">[186]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;These opportunities to share my in-progress work and collaborate with others with different expertise are essential to enhancing the complexities of my projects and arguments. In future extensions of this project, I aim to create online archives that provide greater access to rare movable books, set guidelines for others to assess the best way to digitize an artifact based on certain parameters, and create a useful outline about how to make volumetric captures using affordable technologies. </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">In conclusion, this chapter articulates why pop-ups should be considered a significant part of material book history, not only as evidenced by their ever-gaining presence in special collections libraries and the dedicated Movable Book Society, but also in their ability to visualize scientific, mathematical, and even narrative elements of text. Since pop-up books have expanded to a wide audience of children and adults alike across the globe, they are worthy of inclusion in book digitization efforts to facilitate access and use. Though movable books are challenging to digitize because of their dimensional and temporal displacements, digital humanities offers ways to experiment with emerging technologies to create virtual representations, and it is precisely the elements of movable books that make them challenging to digitize that makes these efforts more significant. This project emphasizes that book digitization has always been incomplete, viewing books as primarily vehicles for text and images, rather than material objects. By digitizing nonstandard book objects like movable books, the emphasis of books as works from a sole genius author gives way to recognition of the important collaborations of papermaker, printer, designer, editor, publisher, and the entire ecology that makes books materialize.</span></p>

    <h2 class="w3-padding-24 w3-text-light-grey" id="replica">Chapter 4: Re(p)lic(a)</h2>
    <p class="c6"><span>3D scanning and printing have created important interventions in terms of visualization, circulation, and preservation. The ability to send a virtual 3D model to researchers across the globe has made research quicker and more accessible than ever before. Furthermore, in </span><span class="c8">Digital Humanities in Practice</span><span>, museum practitioners and scholars argue for the benefits of 3D prints of museum pieces, &quot;which can &#39;stand in&#39; for fragile objects, offer handling opportunities, help demonstrate how an object was used or generate museum replicas for sale&quot; as well as &quot;restore missing parts of objects with replica elements and provide replica objects for loan.&quot;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt187" id="ftnt_ref187">[187]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;I argue that the field of English, specifically book history, has many artifacts that are worthy of the same treatment and consideration as those in archaeology or museum studies. My research explores using experimental methods to digitize nontraditional books, i.e., books that are not best digitized via flatbed scanners or traditional cameras. One subset of these nontraditional books is treasure bindings: books bound with ivory carvings, gemstones, and precious metals. One unique aspect of treasure bindings is that they involved creators outside the traditional labor cycle for bookmaking, including metalsmiths, sculptors, jewelers, and other craftspeople. Creating 3D models of treasure bindings with photogrammetry and material artifacts with 3D printers have the potential to give scholars more opportunities to trace labor, to contextualize historical styles, and to consider these books as aesthetic objects on display. While there are a number of obvious challenges related to the rarity and fragility of treasure bindings, this chapter is going to talk a bit more about history and materiality, sketch an initial attempt to see if the technology would work, and follow with a modest experiment to demonstrate the proof of concept.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c12" id="h.h7gjg39uywhm"><span class="c20">3D Scanning and Printing in Cultural Heritage Preservation and Conservation Efforts</span></h2>
    <p class="c6"><span>In recent years, galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (GLAM) have turned to emerging technologies to experiment in cultural heritage preservation and conservation efforts. Lasers clean dirt off of old paintings,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt188" id="ftnt_ref188">[188]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;X-ray fluorescent imaging uncovers lost text in ancient documents like the Archimedes Palimpsest,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt189" id="ftnt_ref189">[189]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;and CT scans reveal the amulets hidden inside the wrappings of mummies.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt190" id="ftnt_ref190">[190]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;In addition to creating a 3D gold-plated bronze replica of the falcon amulet cast from a 3D print, the Museum of Mediterranean and Near Eastern Antiquities in Stockholm developed an interactive touch-table exhibit where visitors can interact with a 3D model of the mummy of Neswaiu.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt191" id="ftnt_ref191">[191]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;These examples highlight the numerous opportunities 3D models present for new modes of interaction with cultural heritage, whether as virtual models or as 3D printed objects. Stuart Robson, Sally MacDonald, Graeme Were, and Mona Hess take up this position in their chapter &ldquo;3D recording and museums&rdquo; in </span><span class="c8">Digital Humanities in Practice</span><span>.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt192" id="ftnt_ref192">[192]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <h3 class="c2" id="h.k2gvqkedmekz"><span class="c14">3D virtual models</span></h3>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">3D models as valuable assets are likely best recognized in a range from popular culture, especially 3D animated films and video games, to scientific data visualization. But 3D models hold plenty of potential in cultural heritage. As Robson et al. discuss, 3D models can be useful for both museum patrons and museum professionals.</span></p>
    <p class="c6 c17"><span>&ldquo;A 3D model may be used in a display as a surrogate for the real thing, when, for example, a real museum object is out on loan or away for conservation.&hellip; [T]he 3D model offers the potential to subvert, transform or enhance all kinds of museum activity, from the courier trip to the exhibition catalogue, where individually tailored content can be collected on a local mobile device or indexed for subsequent viewing on a personal web page. It can also offer exciting new ways of increasing visitor numbers and public engagement, thus raising profile and generating new income streams, for example, as interactive digital postcards or through the provision of 3D image library content founded on stories stimulating the collection of groups of digital objects.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt193" id="ftnt_ref193">[193]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>Of particular note is how virtual access can increase public engagement, especially at times when physical holdings are unavailable.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt194" id="ftnt_ref194">[194]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;3D models can be made available on desktop websites, mobile augmented reality applications, and even for virtual reality hardware/software. Digital data also allows for hyperlinking to related content in a way that would be impossible with physical printed objects. &ldquo;Exhibition catalogues could become digital artefacts, with material in a show linked to scans of related objects, sites or contexts.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt195" id="ftnt_ref195">[195]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>3D models are not just useful in public facing arenas, but also privately amongst museum professionals. &ldquo;We demonstrate how 3D models of the museum objects could be transmitted electronically to other museums for condition-reporting purposes, before or after loans.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt196" id="ftnt_ref196">[196]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;The idea that a 3D model could be used as evidence of condition at varying stages highlights the notion that physical models can be as ephemeral as digital models. These &ldquo;archival records&rdquo; could be useful to future researchers studying artifacts pre- and post-conservation efforts, or pre- and post-environmental degradation, or even pre- and post-war destruction.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>I am particularly interested in these potentials as they heighten, rather than detract from, the mission of cultural heritage institutions like museums, providing access to more patrons. 3D models serve not as an inferior substitute but a prime example of using emerging technologies to their greatest capabilities. Exhibits in particular have many opportunities to be enhanced by 3D models, especially through touch table displays. Most patrons, denied the ability to touch the original artifacts, appreciate the ability to touch screens to create a more immersive experience. &ldquo;[3D models] could augment the museum viewing experience by giving visitors greater control over what they look at, the ability to turn fragile objects upside down and to see them in high magnification and other privileges normally reserved for curators and conservators.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt197" id="ftnt_ref197">[197]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Most patrons are accustomed to portable touchscreens, and oversized touchscreens in museums offer a wider space to explore, play, and learn.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">Furthermore, 3D models can help academics with object analysis and research. While scholars were previously restricted to studying artifacts they had direct access to, which required extensive travel grants and permissions, 3D models offer opportunities for both distant digital research and collaborations on overlapping artifacts.</span></p>
    <p class="c6 c17"><span>&ldquo;The 3D record represents a &#39;digital fingerprint&#39; of the real object. There is also the potential to better document and characterize materials, by complementing analytical methods, such as fluorescence and pigment analysis. This could aid identification of objects in geographically scattered collections, enable low-cost global interaction and collaboration between curators and academics and lead to new understandings of material culture.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt198" id="ftnt_ref198">[198]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>One aspect that is particularly beneficial of 3D models is that the amount of metadata you can attach is virtually unlimited in size and scope, so while the physical item cannot be physically tagged and connected to anything else, no virtual data is destroyed by attaching and connecting all forms of data. &ldquo;Clearly, this offers real potential for multiple users across the world to study an object that previously only one privileged person could have access to, at any one time.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt199" id="ftnt_ref199">[199]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;This democratization of data is beneficial for so many reasons: a diversity of researchers will likely result in a diversity of interpretations and findings. It will also create a more equitable research arena, rather than privileging those with enhanced financial or prestige pull to gain better access.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>Every argument that is being made for museums could be equally relevant to other cultural heritage institutions, especially libraries. What if a specific copy of a book held metadata that no other copy contained, like the radioactivity of Marie Curie&rsquo;s cookbook? Multiple people could glean different findings from the same artifact. Furthermore, specific findings could help researchers make previously undiscovered connections to other artifacts. &ldquo;Digital objects make these relations visible, through tagging, online annotations, search engines and hyperlinked text. They emphasize the relational nature of the museum and its collections, foregrounding the dispersal of cultural objects that once existed in one particular time and place.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt200" id="ftnt_ref200">[200]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>I also recognize the advantages of artifacts leaving the confines of a museum setting through 3D modeling. &ldquo;There is endless potential for museum artefacts to be accessed and repurposed by new audiences: stored in 3D image libraries; embedded in computer games; inserted into online, personal movies; harvested for school projects.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt201" id="ftnt_ref201">[201]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Of course there will always be legal repercussions to creating &ldquo;copies&rdquo; of any artwork. &ldquo;Some of these concentrate on the problems of liberal access to digital objects via the internet, raising issues of authorship, copyright and theft of the digital copy (Brown, 2005).&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt202" id="ftnt_ref202">[202]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;I argue that this discussion can best be heard in terms of the ethical rights of public domain and intangible cultural heritage. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) prioritizes respect and access in its &ldquo;Ethical Principles for Safeguarding Intangible Cultural Heritage.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt203" id="ftnt_ref203">[203]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">The authenticity of digital artifacts will always be different from the original, but should not immediately be valued as more or less than. Rather, virtual representations of material artifacts still allow for interesting observations and studies.</span></p>
    <p class="c6 c17"><span>&ldquo;3D records of museum artefacts present a real challenge to museum notions of authenticity, in that, although surrogates, they are potentially more engaging than the real artefacts they purport to represent.&hellip; 3D model data has the potential to be endlessly processed and crafted. Gaps can be filled, colours enhanced, detail added and the data resampled to match display and printing device characteristics.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt204" id="ftnt_ref204">[204]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>This notion of authenticity may be truly important as some auratic qualities cannot be replicated. On the other hand, not-original should not universally be recognized as less valuable. The idea that the digital 3D model could be an enhanced version of the physical object helps us to recognize why both forms are valuable. &ldquo;If a cultural object is reproduced as a 3D digital image, how do people relate to its (digital, intangible) derivative?&hellip; From an engineering standpoint, authenticity is embedded in the scientific method and the metric qualities of the documentation.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt205" id="ftnt_ref205">[205]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">Of course, these 3D models are not all made equally and are not as simple as taking a photograph. Therefore, it is important that cultural heritage institutions recognize the benefits of emerging technologies and lend their expertise to these workflows for the betterment of all involved.</span></p>
    <p class="c6 c17"><span>&ldquo;It is important to understand the emerging markets for 3D models of cultural and heritage material; to understand who the users are and how they wish to interact; the model quality required for different applications; and the ways in which these data can form an integral part of the new media museum portfolio. Skills training and development of best practice within the sector are essential to ensure that 3D models are fit for multiple purposes and that, after a one-time capture, their source data can be reworked, if required, for scientific analysis, as well as simple display.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt206" id="ftnt_ref206">[206]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">My research is dedicated to finding possible avenues for creating digitizations and sharing my methods, but I work with a particular audience in mind, scholars like me who want access to the physical material artifact for initial study as well as a digitization in order to assign metadata, use digital search functions, and share digitally to fellow enthusiasts scattered across the globe. As a researcher, I want a certain high-resolution quality, but if it were a detail in a virtual game, I would rather a fast-render/low-resolution than a slow-render/high-resolution. Yet when a virtual model can be zoomed in and out and has no frame of reference, the dimensionality is likely lost. A better way to both represent an object with bumps and make it accessible to nonsighted individuals is to use 3D printing.</span></p>
    <h3 class="c2" id="h.d2e6gymgezyv"><span class="c14">3D printed models</span></h3>
    <p class="c6"><span>While virtual models present their own opportunities, 3D prints offer more immediate tangible benefits, for both professionals and patrons, as well as for the preservation of the artifacts themselves. I highly endorse the sentiment of Houghton Library&rsquo;s curator, John Overholt, that it is &ldquo;crucial to reach out and demystify special collections, to convey the message: &lsquo;Please touch. This is here for you. You are special enough for special collections.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt207" id="ftnt_ref207">[207]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;3D printing offers a realistic way to allow everyone to touch artifacts. As Robson et. al suggest, &ldquo;3D models and prints open up the possibility of creating exact replicas, which can &#39;stand in&#39; for fragile objects, offer handling opportunities, help demonstrate how an object was used or generate museum replicas for sale.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt208" id="ftnt_ref208">[208]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Cultural heritage institutions can better preserve the original if more patrons are interacting with replicas. Likewise, previously &ldquo;untouchable&rdquo; artifacts can now provide replicated haptic experiences, which is a vast improvement for many nonsighted museum goers who interact with the world through touch. Selling replicas in a museum gift shop also allows for visitors to leave with a token, a memento, of their experience. Though I am not certain the technology is quite yet available for sophisticated mixed material objects, for simpler artifacts, the idea that &ldquo;3D printing offers the potential to restore missing parts of objects with replica elements and provide replica objects for loan&rdquo; seems like it would revolutionize conservation and care.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt209" id="ftnt_ref209">[209]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>In my own experience presenting 3D printed replicas, spectators often ask if I can replicate the materials of metal and gemstones. Unfortunately, that technology does not yet exist, and would likely be prohibitively expensive. &ldquo;Certainly, there is currently no way to fully replicate the nonvisual information gained from physically handling the object; the sense of its weight, its warmth, the texture of its surface, its smell.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt210" id="ftnt_ref210">[210]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Likewise, we cannot gain these things from a photograph, and yet most scholars recognize the value of a photograph, even if it is not an authentic or accurate copy of the original thing it represents. 3D representations approach asymptotically closer to &ldquo;the real.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c6 c17"><span>&ldquo;Others have commented how high resolution 3D reproductions of objects shift the boundaries between original and copy, citing Walter Benjamin&#39;s seminal essay on &#39;The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction&#39; ([1935]1970) to question the shedding of the aura of the original in its digital rendition, for example, what are the subtle differences between an original, its digital surrogate and the infinite number of identical copies of that digital surrogate (Brown 2007; Cameron, 2007)?&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt211" id="ftnt_ref211">[211]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">I am less interested in the abstract discrepancies or loss of aura, and more interested in the pragmatic benefits that we still gain, such as understanding of depth and detail of a 3D model that was unavailable in a photograph.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">I argue that books are important to study as material artifacts, as evidenced by their presence not just in libraries but in museums as well. 3D virtual and printed models of books would be particularly useful in a media historical/archaeological approach to codices, especially one-of-a-kind books like treasure bindings. </span></p>

    <h2 class="c12" id="h.1o9q1aez7k8e"><span class="c20">Media History of Treasure Bindings</span></h2>
    <h3 class="c2" id="h.atp5crgmu3ij"><span class="c14">Historical</span></h3>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">Treasure bindings have been crafted since Medieval times, yet precious few remain. These rare relics are housed in a select few museums, mainly in Europe, so access to study these artifacts is very limited. The only way currently to view most treasure bindings is either by setting up a meeting with the special collections library or museum well in advance of visitation or by viewing low-resolution photographs on each individual museum&rsquo;s website. In fact, though the topic of treasure bindings can be found in sections or chapters devoted to bookbinding overall, there is no single monograph on the subject. </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>Treasure bindings, also known as jeweled bindings, are any bookbindings decorated by precious metals, gemstones, ivory carvings, or luxurious fabrics. In S.T. Prideaux&#39;s </span><span class="c8">An Historical Sketch of Bookbinding</span><span class="c0">, she explains the function and creators of treasure bindings. Since labor guilds restricted who could do what, treasure bindings fell more to the goldsmith than the binder.</span></p>
    <p class="c6 c17"><span>&ldquo;In those days [the bookbinder&rsquo;s] functions were merely to fasten together the leaves of the books and place them between two boards, which were then decorated by the [metal]workers in precious metals. If skins were used, [the bookbinder] covered the boards in leather or parchment; after which they passed into other hands for the fixing of metal clasps and hooks to keep the boards shut, and in most cases nails were also inserted, the round and projecting heads of which preserved the flat surface of the binding.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt212" id="ftnt_ref212">[212]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>By delving into records, historians have determined that treasure bindings were referenced in writings as early as 384 A.D., yet it is believed that the earliest extant example is from the 9th century. Treasure bindings were complex due to mixed materials and expensive due to the high price of scribal labor, parchment, and luxurious finishings.</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span>&ldquo;The thick wooden boards--the weight of which was necessary to keep the parchment flat--were enriched with ivories, precious stones, engraved gems, plaques of gold and silver both engraved and filigreed, and the finest enamels.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt213" id="ftnt_ref213">[213]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;The term treasure bindings encompasses books with ivory carvings, full sheets of metal, and metal embellishments. &ldquo;Of the three classes into which these very early bindings most naturally fall, ivories, goldsmith&#39;s work proper, and enamels, the gold and silver work&mdash;pierced, chased, or engraved, and often ornamented besides with precious stones--occupies the middle place, enamelled covers apparently originating when gems became rare.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt214" id="ftnt_ref214">[214]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>These ornate book covers required a great bit of skill on the part of the maker. Over time, metalsmiths were able to refine their techniques and specialize in all things metal, and so the book covers became more intricate. &ldquo;With the 16th and 17th centuries workmanship superseded the weight of the precious metals. The goldsmith of that time had to be sculptor, modeller, smelter, enameller, jewel-mounter, and metal-worker combined, and hence there is more unity about the metal-wrought bindings of that time than there is about the earlier ones.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt215" id="ftnt_ref215">[215]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Most treasure bindings are not entirely metal. &ldquo;Velvet was a favourite material and is the most frequently mentioned in these lists with or without ornamentation.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt216" id="ftnt_ref216">[216]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Though velvets and rich ornamentation are now considered gaudy, at the time, rarity of materials were equated with luxury and royalty.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>Due to their costly nature, most of these artifacts belonged to either the Church or royalty and often remained on display. These were not books whose pages were frequently turned and read. &ldquo;The number that has come down to our times is very small, nor is it surprising that they should not have escaped the plunder that took place during the different vicissitudes of the Church.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt217" id="ftnt_ref217">[217]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Already put on a pedestal (metaphorically and literally), treasure bindings in the Church became objects of veneration even more so when they doubled as reliquaries (vessels to hold relics of the saints). &ldquo;As the books were not often transported from place to place, indeed but little moved, the weight of their covers was not a matter of importance, and these were sometimes made to contain relics of the saints.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt218" id="ftnt_ref218">[218]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;It is likely that the macabre fascination with books bound in human skin would certainly transfer to jeweled books containing finger bones of saints.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>Treasure bindings always symbolize importance, either of the text or of the owner. &ldquo;A beautifully bound book was a work of art, indicating the owner&#39;s taste, wealth and social position. In portraits, aristocrats were often shown holding finely bound books&hellip;. We know which books were considered important by the fact that they were given expensive coverings.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt219" id="ftnt_ref219">[219]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Therefore, these bindings became not only economically and aesthetically valuable, but religiously invaluable as well. Because the texts were important enough, copies needed to be made, and because the manuscript copying was laborious and expensive, they might as well have luxurious coverings, and since so much money was invested in the artifacts, more attention was given to preserving the artifacts, keeping them polished, guarded, and in nearly pristine condition. </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>Gem-encrusted bindings, however, were not just symbolic of wealth; during the Middle Ages, stones were believed to possess medicinal and magical properties, as evidenced by lapidary (gemology) books. &ldquo;Lapidaries are books of information about the properties and virtues of precious and semi-precious stones. Each entry in a lapidary usually tells of the color and origins of the stone, as well as its medicinal, magical, moral, and protective properties.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt220" id="ftnt_ref220">[220]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;The stones were likely then more symbolically connected to the owner than the content of the text.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">Unfortunately, despite the durability of materials like gold, silver, and precious stones, there are many obstacles in place to preserving these treasured objects. Changes over time are the main culprits, in terms of familial wealth, religious ideologies, and scientific knowledge. </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">To begin with, bejeweled Books of Hours were often wedding gifts for the bride, and records of historical wills indicate that they were passed down through the family. Future generations of families, however, were not necessarily as wealthy and descendants would often melt down the gold or pick off the gems and sell them. Treasure bindings with ivory carvings have sustained the longest only because they cannot be melted down or plucked.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>Secondly, from Middle Ages to now, there have been several destructive periods of iconoclasm. &ldquo;The number that has come down to our times is very small, nor is it surprising that they should not have escaped the plunder that took place during the different vicissitudes of the Church.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt221" id="ftnt_ref221">[221]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;During the Siege of Constantinople, the Crusaders smashed altars of churches for their gold and stole anything of value. During the Protestant Reformation, there was a wholesale destruction of all art in Catholic churches that could potentially by revered or worshipped, which is a devastating loss for art historians. </span></p>
    <p class="c6 c17"><span>&ldquo;Few jewelled bindings have come down to our time, for they were too valuable to escape the cupidity of rulers and the fury of reformers. In England, the spoliation of the monasteries under Henry VIII., and the wholesale destruction under Edward VI of all vestiges of the old learning wrought irremediable havoc amongst the fine libraries, and such rich bindings as might have till then escaped were swept away under the act &lsquo;to strip off and pay into the king&#39;s treasury all gold and silver found on Popish books of devotion.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt222" id="ftnt_ref222">[222]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>Additionally, the Renaissance and Enlightenment periods gave us a better understanding of the world, and the belief that gemstones held magical properties was simply no longer in effect. As western society became more secularized, and the number of churches dwindled, and the number of saints being venerated diminished, the need for treasure bound books shrunk as well. &ldquo;The disappearance of these costly kinds of decoration for books was very gradual and even after the taste for the more precious metal ornaments had subsided and given place to the hardly less elaborate tooling of leather covers the use of silver clasps with or without corners continued.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt223" id="ftnt_ref223">[223]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;The knowledge of the craft was similarly lost.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>Though we can see that the nature of treasure bindings as religiously, aesthetically, and monetarily valuable objects all helped and hindered their longevity, what is most antithetical to typical book preservation and conservation efforts is the emphasis on the binding and the all but dismissal of the text itself. Though we know that metal has a superior longevity and durability, only the outsides of the book were treated with these materials; the pages were still made out of paper or parchment, not metal sheets. If the information was truly of great importance, why was less care given to it than the aesthetics? Historians have found that the text in religious treasure bound books is often missing pieces or is a distortion of the original. &ldquo;Silver or elaborately-carved ivory plaques did not form part of the structure of the book but were made separately and then nailed onto the wooden boards of a binding. These plaques were often transferred from book to book as texts wore out.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt224" id="ftnt_ref224">[224]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">These books were not seen as part of the library, something to be read, but as decoration only to be used ceremoniously. Nowadays, several treasure bindings do not even contain the original pages they were bound with, but are replaced by anything that suits it aesthetically. </span></p>
    <p class="c6 c17"><span>&ldquo;Those extant are scattered over various museums and libraries of Europe, and it is unfortunately very rare to find any previous to the 12th century on the manuscripts for which they were originally designed. Torn from what they once covered on account of their worth they have either been recaptured and applied to others of later date; or the book itself ceasing to be of value, they have been removed and kept as works of art on account of their beauty or historic interest.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt225" id="ftnt_ref225">[225]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">What a radical change from the initial purpose of treasure bindings: to enhance the importance of the text!</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>Currently, most treasure bindings&rsquo; creators are unidentified, as attribution was normally only given to author and printer, but with more time to study the unique patterns, it may be possible to more precisely identify the makers. &ldquo;A binding may help date and place a manuscript, give information about trade routes and the spread of ideas, indicate its owner&#39;s social and economic status or aspirations, reflect contemporary artistic taste, indicate the significance of texts and the level of technology at a given time.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt226" id="ftnt_ref226">[226]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">This research could be groundbreaking because even though little is currently known on women&rsquo;s roles in treasure binding, if the 3D models and their tagged descriptions on techniques can be cross-referenced with recent research on women silversmiths, it is possible that it could reveal more female involvement in what has been largely assumed to be a male-dominated business. Women served as bookbinders and as silversmiths, so it is likely that they at some point had a hand in making treasure bindings.</span></p>
    <p class="c6 c17"><span>&ldquo;Less fortunate sections of society were sometimes taught binding as a means of earning a living. In nineteenth-century England, women off the streets learned the trade in a Hackney workshop, sponsored by the Salvation Army&hellip; There are early references to woman binders&hellip;. Jane Steel &hellip;ran one of the most successful binding shops in early eighteenth-century London and bills survive with details of her work. Widows were also well placed to take over binders&#39; workshops.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt227" id="ftnt_ref227">[227]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>In future iterations of this project, collaborations with projects like </span><span class="c8">Women&rsquo;s Book History</span><span>&nbsp;could hopefully yield the answers to women&rsquo;s roles in treasure bindings, and I also envision that my own making endeavors will inspire other women to make treasure bindings in the future.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt228" id="ftnt_ref228">[228]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>Treasure binding artifacts are not only of value because of their costly ornamentation, their religious significance in storing relics of the saints, or even for the medicinal and magical properties that the gems encrusted wield; the mere fact that they have survived also bears witness to a narrative of humanity. From a substantially higher number of original treasure bindings, fewer than one hundred survive, scattered across the globe; after several periods of iconoclasm, ravaging of war, natural disasters, and human greed, somehow, these few artifacts remain intact. They are precious mementos of Western cultural heritage. PJ Marks suggests that &ldquo;Only a visual record will serve to identify an individual binding.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt229" id="ftnt_ref229">[229]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;She recommends photocopies or rubbings for accurate dimensions. &ldquo;A photocopy of the binding provides a cheap and effective record of it and does not cause damage&hellip;. [R]ubbings&hellip; reproduce actual-size images of the tooling...&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt230" id="ftnt_ref230">[230]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Yet based on my own experience, it is practically impossible for a researcher to touch treasure bindings, let alone rub them, or lay them upside down in a photocopier. </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>The enhanced metadata through research annotations is more likely and more valuable. &ldquo;A brief written description is also useful. [Unfortunately,] there is no universally accepted standard terminology for describing a binding.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt231" id="ftnt_ref231">[231]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;In the future, a standardization of binding terminology could make aggregating tagging metadata much more useful, as is the case with Library of Congress catalog tags. Marks ends by suggesting, &ldquo;Bindings can now be scanned, digitized and stored in computer databases.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt232" id="ftnt_ref232">[232]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;I will return to this suggestion in a later section.</span></p>
    <h3 class="c2" id="h.f0ved66nqr08"><span class="c14">Contemporary Popular Culture Examples</span></h3>
    <p class="c6"><span>Treasure bindings are not just relics of the past; their endurance and elevated status have served as inspiration for more contemporary codices. One notable example is the book prop used at the beginning of the 1959 </span><span class="c8">Sleeping Beauty</span><span>&nbsp;film. The one-of-a-kind oversized illustrated book is luxuriously bound with a gold-foiled spine, a jewel-encrusted hammered brass cover, and cost $1500 to make (adjusted for inflation that would be over $13,000 in 2020).</span><sup><a href="#ftnt233" id="ftnt_ref233">[233]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Walt Disney clearly commissioned it to hearken the importance of the timeless narrative of Sleeping Beauty as well as elevate the status of his animated film by visually referencing an old-fashioned medium. In 2003, The Walt Disney Gallery sold 2500 hollow bejeweled golden &ldquo;Treasure Book&rdquo; replicas. In 2020, shopDisney sold oversized journal replicas for $29.99.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt234" id="ftnt_ref234">[234]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Another popular culture example is JK Rowling&rsquo;s seven handmade copies of </span><span class="c8">Tales of Beedle the Bard</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;that she commissioned in 2007 for &ldquo;those most closely connected to the Harry Potter books during the past 17 years.&rdquo; The Sotheby&rsquo;s auction catalogue description of the seventh copy read: </span></p>
    <p class="c6 c17"><span>&ldquo;individually handwritten and extensively illustrated by the author, c.160 pages containing c.5500 words, 8vo, written in an Italian hand-made notebook with acid-free deckle-edged cream-coloured leaves (167 by 111mm.), bound in brown morocco (175 by 114mm.) embellished on upper cover by Edinburgh silversmiths Hamilton and Inches, with five individually hand-chased hallmarked sterling silver ornaments and mounted moonstones, spine in compartments with raised bands, folding clasp, green endpapers, green head and foot bands together with green marker ribbon&hellip;. The binding and embellishments were inspired by an ancient Italian prayer book. The sterling silver cornerpiece ornaments each bear a single motif from one of the stories, comprising a leaf, heart, fountain and a human foot. The central sterling silver panel includes a skull motif. Moonstones are also mounted. Within magical mythology moonstones promote selflessness and unconditional love. These qualities foster nurturing and mothering qualities. Each sterling silver ornament is hand-chased and hallmarked.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt235" id="ftnt_ref235">[235]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">It is evident that this contemporary treasure binding takes inspiration from historical artifacts in composition, design, and materiality. Amazon purchased this one-of-a-kind book for about $4 million and created 1000 limited edition replicas with metallic and gemstone embellishments.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">In each of these cases, the book was bejeweled because the contents it held were important. While treasure bindings may have been the medieval equivalent of the solid gold iPhone case, their existence signals the importance of the physical material books as revered commodities, a relevant detail in our bibliographic cultural heritage. Yet the limited-edition replicas elevate the status of the owner/collector, just like in history. Unlike the biblical content of most treasure bindings in museums, these books are secular texts, yet they have devoted fanbases, much like Christianity. This is a point I will return to in my own creation of a special edition treasure binding.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c12" id="h.ky8d0akpefbd"><span class="c20">Experience with Walters Art Museum</span></h2>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">I began the preliminary stages of 3D scanning and printing treasure bindings with the aid of Lynley Herbert, Curator of Rare Books and Manuscripts at the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland in March 2015. While most of the artifacts were unavailable for scanning due to exhibition and preservation schedules, the T&#39;oros Roslin Gospels (W. 539), an Armenian manuscript dating back to 1262, was available for research. </span></p>

    <p class="c6"><span>This trial allowed me the opportunity to experiment with different workflows, encounter typical museum conditions and regulations, and gain valuable insight into the preservation and conservation of these precious objects. Due to the sensitive nature of the manuscripts, the room was kept in low light, which presented a problem for the three RGB cameras I brought with me: the Microsoft Kinect, the Canon Rebel XTi digital single lens reflex camera, and the rear camera on the second-generation iPad. The Kinect also includes a non-destructive depth sensor camera using infrared, which was unaffected except in its coordination with the RGB camera.</span></p>

    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">The three methods I tested were Microsoft Kinect hardware with Skanect software, a desktop photogrammetry app with still photographs, and the iPad mobile app, 123D Catch by Autodesk. The low lighting resulted in blurred photos since I took photographs with my single-lens reflex camera, but without a tripod, rendering the photographs unusable. The low lighting also caused some color distortions and unmapped surfaces when I used the Microsoft Kinect and the Skanect software, also resulting in an unusable model. Figuring this out in the first stage allowed me to account for this in new steps to the workflow.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 468.00px;"> <img src="img/w3images/image12.png" alt="photo of laptop and screen showing red and green partial 3D scan of treasure binding book" class="w3-image"> </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">By using the iPad and the now defunct app 123D Catch, I slowly walked around the artifact, being certain to capture as many angles as possible. The app then sent the data off of the mobile device to be processed using photogrammetry and created the best model. I also learned from this trial that treasure bindings cannot be placed facedown, so capturing the underside of the book presents a real challenge. </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 390.67px;"> <img src="img/w3images/image40.png" alt="screenshot of 3D model of 3d scanned-treasure binding book cover and fore edge" class="w3-image"> </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">The virtual model captures some details incredibly well, including the threads peeking from the binding, the worn leather of the straps, and the crinkle and distressed color of the pages. The model also captured some extraneous detail like the stickers on my laptop and a large portion of the table. The model is also not solid, and when flipped over is a concave inside the book. However, I was able to make the model solid with a false flat layer using Meshmixer. </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 390.67px;"> <img src="img/w3images/image14.png" alt="screenshot of Meshmixer interface of grayed out 3d scanned 3d model of treasure binding book and outlines with dimensions" class="w3-image"> </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">I was then able to send the solid model .obj file to Marston Science Library at the University of Florida where they used the Fusion F306 to 3D print the book using PLA filament. PLA filament is a non-toxic polylactic acid plastic that does not print photorealistic textures. The nozzle head builds up the print layer by layer, creating a sort of topographic appearance, rather than an ultra-smooth texture. The interesting features still visible in the 3D printed version are the clasps holding the book, the irregularities of the pages, the four decorative corners, and the raised jewels forming the main cross in the center of the book cover.</span></p>

    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">This proof of concept catalyzed my continuing research, and though I attempted to collaborate with the Morgan Library and Museum to create 3D models of their treasure binding collection, that avenue of support did not come to fruition. In order to have access to create 3D virtual and material models of treasure bindings, I recognized the value in making my own to generate more proofs of concept to generate more interest and trust in my project, to make future collaborations with cultural heritage institutions more feasible.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c12" id="h.e3j41j8m2892"><span class="c20">Creating a Special Edition Treasure Binding F Book</span></h2>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">The difficulties and constraints in gaining access and prime lighting conditions to create 3D prints of treasure bindings propelled me to design and create my own contemporary treasure binding. Though I am not an expert bookmaker or bookbinder, the available materials to create a workable prototype were not beyond my grasp. In determining what text might be worthy of creating a special edition treasure binding, I contemplated which fan base could serve as an audience that wanted a treasure bound special edition book. I considered the University of Florida guide book, affectionately known as the &ldquo;F Book.&rdquo; My own copy that I received as a freshman reads, </span></p>
    <p class="c6 c17"><span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re holding a piece of </span><span class="c8">treasure</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;[emphasis added] in your hands- the &lsquo;F Book&rsquo; is quite literally a living piece of history of the University of Florida, chronicling the rich traditions of the Gator Nation throughout the decades. Recently revived since its disappearance in the early 1960s, this University of Florida student publication is presented to all incoming freshmen as a guide to ensure that all Gators are aware of the active role they can play in the larger history of UF.&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 624.00px;"> <img src="img/w3images/image29.jpg" alt="photo of 7 different F Books from 1930-1939, six are blue and orange and the top center is black and yellow" class="w3-image"> </span></p><p class="c6><span class="c0">My research in the University archives and special collections revealed that these guidebooks were originally meant to be pocket-sized, so students could carry around important information and access at a moment&rsquo;s notice. Notable inclusions in the old F Books included an academic calendar, advice to new students, a pullout campus map, campus guidelines and traditions, and a history of UF timeline. These were created and distributed when the student body size was much smaller, and discontinued in the 1960s, though briefly revived in the early 2000s before the Student Alumni Association switched the delivery to a digital format. Though students can now access much of this information at a moment&rsquo;s notice through mobile devices, the sense of history and tradition is lost. Furthermore, by continually overwriting to provide the most up-to-date information, we lose the yearly snapshots. To preserve my own snapshot in my final year at this university, I decided to make a treasure binding F Book.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">Once again, to avoid copyright issues, I wrote and designed my own F Book. I selected a 5.5&rdquo; x 5.5&rdquo; square design for the pages as it is the largest square design for a standard US Letter sheet of paper (8.5&rdquo; x 11&rdquo;) folded in half so that it could be printed on standardized US desktop printers. I divided the content in sections and designed section heading graphics of some of the most iconic campus windows, including the Gator Booster Offices for &ldquo;UF History &amp; Traditions,&rdquo; Library West for &ldquo;UF Academic Resources,&rdquo; the Baughman Center for &ldquo;UF Student Living Tips,&rdquo; the Reitz Student Union for &ldquo;UF Campus Resources,&rdquo; the Harn Museum of Art for &ldquo;UF Photo Scavenger Hunt,&rdquo; and the Century Tower for the &ldquo;UF Calendar 2019-2020.&rdquo; I then had the 128-page document printed on 100% cotton paper at the local print shop, Target Copy.</span></p>

    <p class="c6"><span>I printed the document on 100% cotton paper. I used an awl and a punching jig to create symmetrical holes in each signature of 4 folded sheets.

    <p class="c6"><span>I then used a silver Krylon leafing pen to silver-gilt the edges of the pages. &ldquo;[A gilt edge] has the practical function of protecting the contents from dust.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt236" id="ftnt_ref236">[236]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <h3 class="c2" id="h.berqzaavtdjf"><span class="c14">Constructing the Cover</span></h3>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">In order to construct the cover, I designed a template in Adobe Illustrator and cut it on textured cardstock using the Silhouette Cameo. I used the main structure of the F in the center, and the four corners that usually represent the gospels in historic treasure bindings have been replaced with a Florida orange, the Florida state outline, a Florida Gator, and a blue Morpho butterfly. The design also uses a winding helical structure to visually reference DNA.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 624.00px;"> <img src="img/w3images/image33.jpg" alt="photo of yellow cardstock template outline with shapes cut out along edge, top left orange, top right Florida, bottom left alligator, bottom right, butterfly, center F" class="w3-image"> </span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>I then traced the template using a silver Sharpie on a 6&rdquo; x 6&rdquo; sheet of .625 sterling silver. After tracing the template, I used a technique called &ldquo;chasing&rdquo; using a hammer to guide a small chiseled metal tool to slightly indent along an outline. I then used the technique called &ldquo;repousse&rdquo; to use a hammer to indent the metal out from the back so that it is embossed on the front.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt237" id="ftnt_ref237">[237]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;I then use a metal hole punch to punch holes for the crystal rivets.</span></p>

    <p class="c6"><span>Next, I attached the velvet paper to the book board and punched holes in the board aligned with the holes in the metal. I then used four crystal rivets to attach the sheet of silver to the board. The rivet starts as two pieces, and then I used a hammer to connect the two pieces. &ldquo;Cloth, including velvet, satin and embroidered canvas, was considered appropriate for luxury bindings.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt238" id="ftnt_ref238">[238]</a></sup></p>

    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">I continue to use the hammer to connect the remaining 100 crystal rivets in a DNA-reminiscent design with orange and blue rivets. I also use a crystal setting punch in the four corner designs to prepare for gluing the Swarovski crystals.</span></p>

    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">Once the book was materially constructed, I contemplated multiple modes to build a 3D virtual model. There is no guide on the best method to make 3D models from physical artifacts because different artifacts require different approaches and prioritize different attributes. Most virtual 3D models have a mesh and a photo texture, but only certain types of 3D printers can print textures, most just print the shape. Treasure bindings present particular troubles because of their reflective and highly detailed surfaces, their sensitivity to light, and their inflexibility to multiple positions.</span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>

    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">This mode was initially the most appealing because the scanner includes an automatic turntable and software that will laser scan the object on the turntable at regular intervals. However, due to the highly reflective cover, the scanner was unable to make a model. The guide recommended covering the shiny surface with a powder, which would have defeated the purpose (and would be impossible to do with cultural heritage artifacts).</span></p>

    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">This mode used an iPad, a 3D printed rig, the Structure Sensor, and the itSeez3D iOS app. The 3D printed rig attaches the sensor with a depth camera to work in conjunction with the iPad&rsquo;s built in camera. The user walks slowly around the object holding the iPad with both hands to try to capture the object from every angle. While I was able to check out all of these items from the library for free, the sensor would normally cost ~$500, the iPad would cost ~$350, and the itSeez3D iOS app has a free version, but costs $7 to export each model. After realizing that the model had no refined detail and the texture was blurred, I decided to try a different approach.</span></p>

    <p class="c6"><span>I captured 258 photographs at different angles and followed the steps in the software guide to create the 3D model, including aligning the photos, resizing the boundary region, building a dense cloud, deleting extraneous points, building the mesh, and building the texture.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt241" id="ftnt_ref241">[241]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;These steps ensured that I was only creating the model from the parts of the photographs that I wanted and not including background detail. It also made sure that I was connecting the basic model to the texture so that the points of color matched the points of depth. I then exported the model as an .obj object file with a .mtl material file and a .jpg image file. These files work in tandem to connect photorealistic textures to solid basic models. The entire process took several hours. I then uploaded this model to Sketchfab.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt242" id="ftnt_ref242">[242]</a></sup></p>

    <h3 class="c2" id="h.mh40cbn8vko9"><span class="c14">3D Printing from .STL</span></h3>
    <p class="c6"><span>The next step was to make the model solid for 3D printing. I again used the free Autodesk software, Meshmixer, to create a solid model, using the Plane Cut, Zipper Edge, and Make Solid tools and functions.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt244" id="ftnt_ref244">[244]</a></sup></p>
    <p class="c6"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 624.00px;"> <img src="img/w3images/image25.png" alt="screenshot of 3D model of treasure binding F book in all white" class="w3-image"> </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">As I mentioned earlier, the best file type for a virtual 3D model is not the same as one for 3D printing. The most standard file type for 3D printing is .STL, a stereolithographic file. Fortunately, the conversions are easily made in many 3D model softwares, so I exported the .STL file and sent it to be 3D printed. Marston Science Librarian, Dr. Sara Gonzalez, 3D printed my model on a Duplicator using 1.75 mm gold PLA filament. The 3D printer prints thin layers of filaments on top of each other. With PLA filament, the 3D printer can leave hollow areas by printing an internal honeycomb structure and keeping the external detail intact. This reduces the weight of the 3D print, and uses less filament, thereby reducing the cost.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 468.00px;"> <img src="img/w3images/image6.jpg" alt="photo of gold plastic 3D printed treasure binding F book on Duplicator 3D printer bed" class="w3-image"> </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">Once I received the final 3D print, I noticed which details were preserved and which were lost. The areas that seemed to conserve the most detail had the most dramatic depth difference. The repoussed F is faintly raised, the helical crystal rivet patterns are easy to discern, but the shallow shapes formed from Swarovski crystals are less noticeable. This may have also been caused by the Swarovski crystals creating distortions when originally photographed, making the 3D model less defined. </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;"> <img src="img/w3images/image44.jpg" alt="side-by-side photo of silver treasure binding F book and 3D printed replica in gold plastic" class="w3-image"> </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>The 3D model is sturdy, easy to handle and pass around, and would provide many of the benefits outlined in the earlier sections in terms of providing touch access to patrons, creating stand-ins while items are in conservation or on exhibition, and creating souvenirs. In the future, I would love to have a color realistic 3D print, or have the cover 3D printed, but still have the book filled with real pages of text. The true magic of 3D printing models is how easy it is for anyone to have a 3D print if they have access to the file and a 3D printer (or a service like Shapeways</span><sup><a href="#ftnt245" id="ftnt_ref245">[245]</a></sup><span class="c0">). Cultural heritage institutions could provide files so that anyone can create their own 3D print, selecting different colors or scaling up or down as desired. There are obvious challenges to creating facsimiles, but what I came up with was a solid proof of concept. With a grant, I could consult real metalsmithing experts, train and use expert equipment, use a high-resolution scanner, and a high-resolution 3D printer to print in metal, glass, and other high-end materials.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c12" id="h.z8zjhl3wftp9"><span class="c20">Digital Humanities and Book History Blend Past and Future</span></h2>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">The intersections of the book history and digital humanities fields creates fascinating blends of past and future. Current technologies allow us to more accurately speculate on who made books, how books were made and used, and why certain design decisions were made popular. My selection of treasure bindings was not random; these books are always in museums and not libraries due to their material value. They are books that are often seen but seldom read. Treasure bindings highlight the collaborative nature of medieval bookmaking practices, which directly correlates to the highly collaborative nature of digital humanities practices. The fields of book history and digital humanities are, at their cores, about technology and people. Book history studies what has been done in the past with available technologies and digital humanities experiments with what can be done with present technologies as well as speculate what could be done with future technologies. I argue that digital humanities derives in important respects from the history of the book and that the two fields can continue to inform and build upon each other.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">What is often considered the first major digital humanities project traces back to translating text from one medium (physical) to another (digital). Book history studies how text is presented in different media, from the wax tablet, to the scroll, to the manuscript, to the printed codex, to the digital book. I also argue that this overlap creates many opportunities to collaborate with cultural heritage institutions like libraries and museums for mutually beneficial goals of preservation, conservation, and access. This consideration decidedly expands our notions of preservation and conservation for 21st century cultural heritage institutions.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">What aspects of an artifact need to be preserved the most? Can a digital replica substitute for interaction keeping the original artifact safe? Can we remove patina and restore natural colors in a digital format while preserving the inevitable deterioration evident in the original? How can a collection be reenvisioned as not a physical site, but a web site, creating a digital repository for geographically dispersed artifacts?</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>Another fascinating ability of digital humanities is to revive interest in a forgotten medium. Just as the University of Victoria Maker Lab &ldquo;prototypes the past,&rdquo; this project also prototypes the historic art form of treasure bindings.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt246" id="ftnt_ref246">[246]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;It involves research and experimentation recognizing that not all questions will be answered and new ideas will be discovered based on materials available in the 21st century. In what ways is a Swarovski crystal the 21st century equivalent of a gemstone in the past?</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>Finally, my goal is to remove the intimidation typically associated with using 3D technologies and to expand this into a larger project. When I introduce students to 3D printing in humanities courses, it helps them recognize that it is just another technology and not something reserved for a select few. One student reflected, &ldquo;[3D] printing especially seemed like a very scary, high-tech thing that I was way too inexperienced with to even think about trying. But with this class there was a quick turn around [</span><span class="c8">sic</span><span>] from not knowing a thing to teaching others how to make it.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt247" id="ftnt_ref247">[247]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;In the future, I envision collaborations with students to make critical digitizations of books using (and maybe even making) emerging technologies.</span></p>

    <!--Conclusion-->
    
    <h2 class="w3-padding-24 w3-text-light-grey" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="c6"><span>To rephrase Leah Price&rsquo;s evocative question, &ldquo;What do we talk about when we talk about books?&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt248" id="ftnt_ref248">[248]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;I ask, &ldquo;What do we talk about when we talk about nonstandard book objects?&rdquo; We talk about their novelty,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt249" id="ftnt_ref249">[249]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;their weirdness,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt250" id="ftnt_ref250">[250]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;their embellishments.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt251" id="ftnt_ref251">[251]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;My selections of touch-and-feel books, movable books, and treasure bindings were not random. These three types of nonstandard book objects present a diversity of examples and assets on different spectra. On a spectrum of value, touch-and-feel books are well-loved in the domestic sphere, yet often undervalued and then discarded; movable books are often appreciated by multiple people, sometimes collected, can belong in a library or in the public sphere, or be passed on; and treasure bindings are prized to the point that they nearly only reside in museums and no one ever touches them. On a spectrum of audiences, touch-and-feel books are for babies and toddlers, movable books are for children and adults, and treasure bindings are for adults only. On a spectrum of cost, touch-and-feel books are inexpensive, movable books are reasonably priced, and treasure bindings are prohibitively expensive. Yet on a historical spectrum, treasure bindings were designed first, then movable books, and then finally touch-and-feel books.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c12" id="h.4pf254qui13j"><span class="c20">What These Prototypes Argue</span></h2>
    <p class="c6"><span>To reiterate, touch-and-feel books, movable books, and treasure bindings have all been left out of mass book digitization projects, to the detriment of our understanding of what makes a book. If, for example, you search Matthew Van Fleet (notable contemporary touch-and-feel bookmaker)</span><sup><a href="#ftnt252" id="ftnt_ref252">[252]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;or Robert Sabuda (notable contemporary paper engineer)</span><sup><a href="#ftnt253" id="ftnt_ref253">[253]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp; in the Google Books search engine, you will get a long list of results, all with the message, &ldquo;No Preview.&rdquo; It would be even more difficult to attempt to search for treasure bindings in Google Books since the metalsmith is usually not known, and the book is likely an embellished copy of a popular text, like many Books of Hours or Bibles. The best case examples are individual copies scattered on the museum websites.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">It&rsquo;s important to include these neglected material books even though they are not easy to digitize because digitization forms a canon, thereby including books considered &ldquo;valuable&rdquo; and excluding others. I do not believe it is the responsibility of a corporation or even a nonprofit, but rather I would hope that digital humanists that believe in the value of open access and education would participate in this kind of project. </span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">One of the biggest challenges in garnering buy-in for this kind of project is the murky gray areas of copyright. I hope this project helps readers to consider what we&rsquo;re missing out on, but also more broadly that our copyright system needs an overhaul. In the meantime, I think there would be interest from self-published bookmakers, which would perhaps result in a more diverse group as traditional publishing gatekeepers would not be involved.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">Humanists should not only be involved in deciding which books to include, but also in making design choices about what aspects of books to replicate. Digital humanists could also collaborate with designers, computer scientists, and cultural heritage professionals, all of whom would bring important information from their respective fields as to what has been done in the past, what is possible, and what will create the best experience. This project was also designed to assuage any fears about the safety of rare artifacts. Rare artifacts can, in fact, be digitized safely, with the help of an experienced digital humanist.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">What I hope this project also demonstrates is that individual critical digitization is possible with small budgets. It is amazing what one can accomplish with the right technology, whether hardware or software. It is also helpful that so many in technology recognize the benefits of offering educational licenses. This project also required the support of the UF libraries, especially Marston Science Library&rsquo;s Tool Library and Marston Makery, which included the Silhouette Cameo, an iPad, and a 3D printer. In addition to academic libraries, many public libraries are investing in making these technologies (and the education required for proper maintenance and use) available to their patrons.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">Admittedly, this project required a lot of experimentation and reappropriation of technologies designed for other purposes. Digital humanists can and should collaborate with computer and software engineers to create necessary technologies. For instance, in the future I would like to collaborate with virtual reality experts like MimesysVR to create a dedicated portable setup and workflow for creating 4D volumetric captures of objects that cannot be moved to a studio. Or I would enjoy collaborating with software developers like Thomas Storey to create an easier platform for print book designers to transition their books to touchscreen. In any case, digital humanities projects are strongest when they are collaborative.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">Finally, I hope these prototypes argue for the validity and necessity of the two terms I have created, &ldquo;makeademia&rdquo; and &ldquo;fourth-wave digital humanities.&rdquo; The term critical making has a seriousness in its denotation, and those who practice it tend to focus on what is learned through the process of making more so than the object that is made. The terms &ldquo;makeademia&rdquo; as a practice and &ldquo;makeademic&rdquo; as an identity are designed to be less intimidating, and more straightforward in understanding: makeademia is making in academia and a makeademic is an academic who makes, without any other qualifiers. Likewise, I hope I have properly distinguished how the new focus on materializing from the digital sets &ldquo;fourth-wave digital humanities&rdquo; apart from its predecessors. I also hope the examples given demonstrate that this is in fact a trend in scholarship and not a few outlier projects. My own experience in the third iteration of the &ldquo;Physical Computing and Digital Fabrication&rdquo; course at the Digital Humanities Summer Institute assures me that it is a distinct form of digital humanities scholarship, and one that is recognized and popular in the DH community. My hope is that others will use these terms in describing their own projects in digital humanities, and that having the terminology will validate these innovative works that they are doing.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c12" id="h.d9p6a5o3wsqt"><span class="c20">Reflections on Writing the Dissertation </span></h2>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">When I proposed this ambitious project, I felt particularly confident in my abilities to deliver, not because of my own abilities, but because of the support network I had developed that I knew I would have to rely on to pull off this feat. When I said I wanted to try to digitize movable books, UF curator Suzan Alteri helped me write a grant and get funded to experiment with different technologies. When I said I wanted to learn more about emerging technologies, UF librarian Sara Gonzalez hired me to intern at the Marston Science Library to write guides to 3D printing (and then she helped me 3D print my treasure binding models). When I needed help troubleshooting the mechanics of my pop-up book, UF curator and book artist Ellen Knudson gave me insights into prototyping with paper. When I had questions about what bookbinding materials to use and where to purchase them, UF conservator Katie Smith gave me a detailed list of needle, thread, paper, and sites to purchase. When I could not get my code to work for touchscreen, UF alumnus Thomas Storey helped me troubleshoot my code line by line to get it to work. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to learn from all of these brilliant people, and I hope to pass on their knowledge and generosity.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">The expectations of the sole genius author of a dissertation is directly counterintuitive to the collaboration that makes digital humanities projects so much better. Even in writing this dissertation, I gained so much valuable feedback on my drafts from my peers and mentors. But I truly believe this work would be so much better if it was truly a collaboratively-authored piece. Furthermore, writing a dissertation to be subject to formatting outside my control and design is antithetical to all of my arguments about the materiality of books, the power in font, layout, etc. Perhaps, however, this is an exercise in working with constraints. How could I accomplish my goals and make my arguments successful? In short, the most powerful tool at my disposable was the hyperlink, so that I could connect out to all of the brilliant works I was citing, making my work one node in a larger network or ecology of thought. The hyperlink also proved to be valuable in linking to multimedia content that would have been impossible to include in a Word document.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>The organization of this dissertation was directly inspired by Lisa Gitelman&rsquo;s </span><span class="c8">Paper Knowledge: A Media History of Documents</span><span>&nbsp;(2014). Gitelman writes, &ldquo;This book is about the genre of the document glimpsed selectively in four episodes from media history.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt254" id="ftnt_ref254">[254]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Likewise, my dissertation is about the genre of the nonstandard book object glimpsed selectively in three chapters combining a book type&rsquo;s history with a digital humanities digitization project. It was also important to me that the dissertation not just discuss the hypothetical or speculative benefits but actually perform the experiments suggested. I also kept in mind what the authors of </span><span class="c8">Digital_Humanities</span><span>&nbsp;wrote, &ldquo;Documentation is essential for continuity of the project after its initial start-up, and it is an important contribution to the field, as well as a way for others to repurpose the design.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#ftnt255" id="ftnt_ref255">[255]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;So while some of my sections on making the book might seem technical, I hope they serve as important documentation of my process that others can replicate or modify for their own purposes. An especially useful model for this type of scholarship that was recently published is Amaranth Borsuk&rsquo;s article &ldquo;The Abra Codex&rdquo; in </span><span class="c8">Enculturation</span><span>. To show how she makes her book, Borsuk provides photographs of the setup and materials required, animated GIFs that show some of the hands-on and technological processes involved, as well as downloadable PDFs for the reader to print and participate in making their own book copy.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt256" id="ftnt_ref256">[256]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp; Had I seen this earlier in an academic setting, I would have felt more emboldened to include more process visuals rather than just documentation of the final product. The best in-process documentation is included in the last body chapter, &ldquo;Re(p)lic(a),&rdquo; where I included images of the steps to make the book, as well as steps to make the digitization.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">As it is, this project would not have been possible without the support of a &ldquo;nonstandard&rdquo; English department that recognized the value of nontraditional scholarship. My first UF English professor, Donald Ault, encouraged me when I wanted to make comics and paintings for his course. Sid Homan has been subtitling his courses &ldquo;Learning By Doing&rdquo; for years, and has students perform scenes from Shakespeare and modern drama. John Cech and Kenneth Kidd both supported my creative bookmaking projects, Terry Harpold assigned collaborative digital poetics projects, Laurie Taylor and Elizabeth Dale helped me develop the start of my digitizing movable books project, and Sid Dobrin started the Trace Innovation Initiative to encourage our interests in combining technology with English.</span></p>
    <h2 class="c12" id="h.l37d5j88uu5r"><span class="c20">Musing on Future Directions of Research and Speculate about Interdisciplinary Research</span></h2>
    <p class="c6"><span>In the future, I would love to open up </span><span class="c8">The Unique Codex Digitization Project</span><span>&nbsp;as a sort of crowdsourced repository to aid in the virtual reunification of nonstandard book objects. Funding from the National Endowment for Humanities akin to their Fellowships Open Book Program could help in making these books accessible to a wider public.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt257" id="ftnt_ref257">[257]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Not only would I want to collaborate with libraries and museums to digitize their pre-existing collections, but I also want to collaborate with some of the brilliant book artists and bookmakers that I have connected with through opportunities like The Movable Book Society conference to digitize their one-of-a-kind books.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span>I also see the pedagogical value in leading groups of students, whether through my own courses, or professional development opportunities like NEH Summer Institutes, to make their own books and digitize them. In the NEH Summer Institute I attended, &ldquo;The Book: Material Histories and Digital Futures,&rdquo; the final project was to make a nonstandard book object that could be exhibited in the Salt Lake Public Library, and what resulted after three weeks was a vast array of bookworks, artist&rsquo;s books, a physical computing project, an augmented reality book, and even a rotating bookwheel.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt258" id="ftnt_ref258">[258]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;Each participant brought their own interests and knowledge bases to combine with the book types we prototyped together, skill sets we learned, and technologies we used to create stunning works.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">As mentioned previously, I also want to collaborate with technology designers to make the tools that scholars like me need to perform their research. There is no pop-up designer software, no established pop-up digitization technology, no drag and drop touchscreen book maker. I feel fairly certain I am not the only one who would benefit from this hardware or software. Furthermore, I can see these practices extending into more virtual reality environments, and it would be excellent to have humanists involved from the start.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">I would also like to have more copies of the books I made, whether that means finding a publisher, or starting a Kickstarter campaign, or some other approach. I would also love to create more explicit guides and instructions with the necessary files for others to reproduce the books I made. The skills I acquired in making the treasure binding could be useful for cosplayers. Paper engineers might also appreciate having my files as well as an assembly tutorial. The touch-and-feel book would be the most complex because it combines so many different materials, but I could envision an assembly kit that crafters could get that would guide them in making this specific book, and the principles learned could then be applied to their own original books.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c0">In the end, my biggest hope is that reading this work inspires you to make something. It does not have to be a polished product in expensive materials. It does not have to be aesthetically pleasing. In fact, I urge you to consider a prototype. Use it to gauge interest in your research. Use it to start a conversation. The best thing you can make in this world right now is a difference.</span></p>
